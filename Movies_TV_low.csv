I once lent Gilliam's magnum opus Brazil to a dear friend, a stunningly beautiful foreign woman with a completely normal psychological profile and a happy, healthy upbringing (and a conventional, optimistic, aspirational complaisance vis-a-vis the world's sinkholes of damnable exploitation and indifference). She couldn't bring herself to watch it to the end: ""It's too sarcastic!""

Brazil was *gloriously* sarcastic of course, a gorgeous banquet of satirical savagery, eyes wide open to the way silly, all-too-common dreams ruin our common reality (somewhat like Ken Russell's masterpiece The Music Lovers -- which she also, poor beautiful dear, found off-putting).

So this, Gilliam's last fully realized jewel case of phantasmagorical mania and withering British mockery, goes light and whimsical in tone, as though anticipating my lovely friend's reservations, with no urgent mass indictment of privileged delusion; a bit less innocent than The Time Bandits; though not one jot less of free-associational fancy than The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. Tom Waits fans with a nostalgia for color and deadpan silliness should enjoy (Waits himself guesting as a demimonde Mephostophilis); the wan and wistful who still daydream in reverse will smile; cinephiliac adventurers should chortle and clap. There isn't a flaw in this dream; there wouldn't have been a flaw in the execution if Heath Ledger hadn't died, but the painful gap between dreams and Earth anchors the story anyway, so the brotherly, almost-impersonations of Ledger by Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell to fill out the shooting schedule do not in fact kill it off, but make its point truer.  A lovely madness reigns here, Christopher Plummer game for damn near anything true to itself, with an on-the-nose supporting cast.  One grows more grateful with age for risks rarely taken like this.  Gilliam will treat you Special and dazzle you with things other mortals need hallucinogens to think up and most conventional moviegoers would need drink to assimilate.  As piercing  (in its sweet way) as any Errol Morris documentary, and even more welcome.",Glory for the rest of us!,1516579200,,
4.0,False,"05 2, 2006",A2SRP2HP75CUVD,B0019CB5T8,,FULCI_LIVES,"Looking back into my childhood there were certain films which really scared the living hell out of me. Movies like the Changeling, the Exorcist and even the original House on Haunted Hill gave me the creeps and kept me awake in bed late at night. When you look at those films today they are pretty outdated but still have a place in our hearts. Sadly very few movies today can actually scare me and I know its like that for every long time horror viewer. As we get older we mature as human beings and our childhood fears die out. Thats why as we are older it takes a lot more to even make the hairs on our arms stand up. So we all search for at least one film that will actually hope to scare us like when we were kids. Some people found that in movies like the Ring, the Sixth Sense and heck even White Noise. It all depends on the persons individual tastes and fears.

For me personally the thought of dealing with something you know very little about really gets under my skin. Ghosts, demons and just the thought of supernatural forces really gave me the creeps as a kid (still does today). Today I got the chance to check out The Exorcism of Emily Rose. A film which surrounds the court case of Father Moore, a priest who is accused of negligent homicide after a failed exorcism. Moore has been claimed responsible for the death of a 19 year old woman said to be possessed by demons. In a battle between faith vs. science, Father Moore is determined to tell the truth about what happened to Emily Rose.

I know how commercials today can fool viewers. In this case what you see in the commercials are in this movie, but there is a lot more to it. There is more to the plot and the story rather than just being about a girl under the control of demons. About 60 percent of the film takes place in a court room and the story of Emily Rose is told in flashbacks from different characters. Most of it is focused on story and the possibility of what really happened. As mentioned before its basically a battle between faith and science. It works really well with this film and I enjoyed almost every scene. The court room scenes are actually pretty entertaining because it keeps you thinking.

I was amazed at how this movie gave me the creeps. It goes to show you that you don't need an R rating for a horror/thriller film to be good. This movie has no gore and very little blood, but thats the beauty of it. Its not meant to be that way at all. Instead its main focus is to scare the audience and show just how dangerous supernatural forces can be. I thought it worked very well and it really got to me in parts. The court room scenes and the other flashbacks hype you up for the main exorcism scene which comes later. When it hits it goes out with a bang. The exorcism scenes are really intense. Truthfully my heart was pounding the entire time they showed the main exorcism scene near the middle of the film. Being scared is great and being creeped out is just as fun.

I don't know that much about the events which inspired this movie, but after seeing it I'm very curious and most likely will be doing my own research about the true events. Overall I had a pretty good time watching this movie. It gave me the creeps in some parts and it really had me thinking. The story is good and the court room stuff is very interesting to watch. My best advice is seeing this film with an open mind. The commercials never show any of the court room stuff, but it's there and it's the main focus of the film. The scares are also there and it's not like any of the past demonic/possession films we've seen in the past. This one is pretty different and its blended with the idea of questioning what is really possible.","Its intense, entertaining and really keeps you thinking",1146528000,,

I felt the ""who""-dunnit was revealed a bit too soon, though I hoped it would be a different outcome. I suppose this was an attempt at verisimilitude on the part of the writers and director.

The photography, the lighting, the visuals, the use of darkness, silence and symbolism combined with contemporary life in the Living Stations of the Cross are stunning.

If Jesus had incarnated in 1980's Montreal, perhaps this is what He and His French-speaking followers would have looked like -- running up and down the subway escalators, sharing baby-sitting chores, cooking breakfast for guests, visiting friends in airy lofts, stopping by to visit a fellow-actor doing an X-rated and hilarious dubbing session, and talking with Pharisees (the glib lawyer who wants to promote Daniel/Christ in ridiculous ways, mainly to line his own pockets).

This movie says to us - they were all too human 2000 years ago, who's to say they wouldn't be like that today?

Did the film test my faith? No -- nobody who was there 2000 years ago ever painted a complete picture of what it was really like, so I'm open to plenty of interpretation. I was kept spellbound -- by Jesus the human, very well played by Blutheau, by the strength of his two female friends, by the actors -- all taken from various walks of life -- and how the whole troupe eventually blends into a family of sorts. As the film progresses, it is obvious that Daniel (Blutheau) is incorporating his Christ role into his daily life. The ""Trashing of the Studio"", to protest the exploitation of the women who are auditioning for bit parts, evokes the scene in the Bible where Jesus destroys the money-lenders' tables in the temple.

In the end however, some of those who supported Christ/Blutheau, turn into his tormentors and persecutors, but even the tragic ending of this film brings a redemption in the form of modern day miracles - the blind see, the dying live once again, thanks to Daniel/Christ's final gift - his body.

The film opened with two women in a choir loft singing a haunting refrain. It ends with these same two women, sitting on the floor of the Metro, singing the same songs, begging for coins. This is the same Metro station where the dying Christ (Blutheau) was brought, during his last moments of consciousness.

One viewing is not enough. But by all means -- please see this film at least once.","Abandon all your preconceived notions, all ye who enter here",1111795200,,

However, Kenneth Branagh has managed to make it work. By transplanting the story to the late 1930's and capturing the general mood of the play in songs from musicals of that era, he has managed to keep Shakespear's play intact, while adding the visual elements necessary in movie.
The choreography is absolutely stunning, even more so when one realises that none of the performers is a professional dancer. The songs and the text of the original work flow seemlessly into one another.
As always one of Branagh's greatest achievements is the selection of the cast, assembling an unlikely combination of actors and actresses, most whom would at first seem unsuitable to Shakespeare and to get a more then creditable preformance from this group.

Behrens,"""The King of England and the woman for whom he gave up a throne"" has nearly passed into legend, as has the much re-recorded abdication speech give by Edward VIII in which he explained in his own voice (kings by tradition had no right to express personal opinions in public) that all he wanted was to be with the woman he loved. Whether or not she was a scheming Lady Macbeth who wanted to be a queen will never really be known, but it makes an interesting challenge for an actress who plays the part of the American, twice-divorced Mrs. Simpson.

 I was delighted to learn that A&E has restored the 1978 mini-series, ""Edward & Mrs. Simpson"" in a boxed set of two DVDs (AAE 71753). In seven episodes of 50 minutes each, it tells the tale of how Edward (Edward Fox) first runs into Wallis Simpson (Cynthia Harris), becomes obsessed with her, drives all of the higher-ups in the British government half mad seeking ways to satisfy their master and at the same time stopping a marriage which could not constitutionally exist.

 As scripted, Simpson is no sympathetic character but a woman used to getting what she wants, even if it is  the next King of England. Unhappily, Edward (who is called David throughout the series) is shown to be a spoiled brat who often puts his pleasures before his duties; and by the time one might really feel sorry for him, some can only say, ""What did you expect?"" and ""You got what you thoroughly deserved.""

 As fine as Fox and Harris are as actors, there is none of that special ""chemistry"" needed to convince us that these two were (or at least that he was) so madly obsessed with each other. And while there is much talk about how fascinating Wallis was to all who met her, the viewer hardly sees anything matching that description.

 But what a pleasure it is to see consummate actors do their stuff, especially supported by such British stars as Nigel Hawthorne, Peggy Ashcroft (as the outraged Queen Mary),  John Shrapnel, David Waller (as the long-suffering Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin), Patricia Hodge (from the Rumpole series), and too many others to mention here.

 A final irony is found in the bonus feature, ""Wallis Simpson"" from A&E's Biography series, when we are told that Simpson was carrying on another affair all through her stalking of Edward! It would be interesting to know how this would have changed the script if this information were known back then.

 In sum, although I think that just under six hours is far too long to carry this story and keep things sparking (150 minutes would have been about right), I can still recommend this set for the acting, the period dcor, and the discussions it is bound to stimulate among the viewers.",Was SHE worth giving up a crown?,1109203200,76,

Yet another alien invasion film dealing with possession and the threat of atomic weapons-- all well-trod motifs in 1950s science fiction. Here John Agar plays a scientist named Steve Marsh and he is taken over by a megalomaniac alien named Gore. so far a cliche. However, another brain from the planet Arous, named Val, acts as a policeman and instructs Steve's girlfriend how to get rid of Gore. The use of a bad alien and a good alien makes this film slightly better than too many one-dimensional alien invasion films where aliens are evil, wicked, and must be destroyed. I've always preferred the sympathetic alien films, and loathe such films as Independence Day which ridicules such an idea. I believe if aliens exists that they must be benevolent and not wicked. At any rate, it is impressive that John Agar got to play two roles simultaneously: the nice scientist Steve, and the megalomaniac Gore. Yet the film has a Puritanical streak in it, for example, Steve can only be passionate and lustful when possessed by Gore, indicating that lust and rough sex was only permitted if one is a megalomaniac alien invader. The sets are very ordinary, and special effects are cheap. For a Puritanical film it is interesting to see scenes of Sally wearing tight jeans out in the desert, with a brief glance of her butt. On the whole, a rather short but enjoyable film spoilt by an absurd and clumsy ending. Most of the film has the floating brain as a holographic image, but at the end the brain has materialized and is solid and thus can be destroyed.

When it seemed too long I looked at the timer on the DVD player and 3 1/2 minutes had passed - just a camera passing across the desert.  Then the camera picks up two lone figures walking up the road, a young black mother and her child.  They pass two women who ask them how far it is to their village.  ""We've been walking over two hours"", the young woman says.  She clearly has far to walk still.

The woman finally arrives at her destination - to get in line to see a Doctor who comes to the neighboring village once a week.  Although she has walked for hours, and has the return walk ahead of her, she is told that she is too late.  A man comes up to interrupt the Doctor's line - about 20 patients ahead of her.  Then I got it.  The long opening camera shot was designed to give me, the comfortable viewer, some sense of the uncomfortable nature of life in these African villages. Although the woman had walked through the desert for hours she was too late - and the Doctor wouldn't be returning for a week. I felt ashamed at being annoyed by the opening 3 1/2 minute shot of the desert.  Director Darrell Roodt had me.  The director of the acclaimed ""Cry, the Beloved Country"" returns with another story that must be told about his native South Africa.

The young mother was ""Yesterday"", played by Leleti Khumalo of ""Hotel Rwanda"", and she was leading her daughter ""Beauty"", played by Lihle Mvelase.  Yesterday is a Zulu, and Roodt makes the film ring true by having the entire film in Zulu, so a warning to those who hate to read subtitles or don't speak Zulu.

It dawns on us that Yesterday has some awful disease - from her coughing at night I at first thought she might have T.B. but we learn that the news is perhaps even worse.  Her husband (in a brief but effective performance by Kenneth Khambula), on one of his rare trips home from the Johannesburg mines, has infected her with H.I.V.

The film never gets preachy.  There are scenes of heart-warming compassion - such as the teacher in her village (played well by Harriet Lenabe) probably only slightly better off financially than impoverished Yesterday, who offers to watch Beauty so that Yesterday can get to the weekly Doctor visit in time in the village on the other side of that long walk we see in the opening scene, then secretly hires a taxi to carry Yesterday even more quickly.  There are also scenes full of painful anguish - with perhaps none worse than the scene where Yesterday tracks down her husband at the mine to give him the news.

We don't get to see pharmaceutical companies and governments and whatever decisions go into making treatment for AIDS available or, perhaps more importantly, affordable.  We get to see a compassionate Doctor (played by Camilla Walker), strapped for resources, who tries to help hundreds of patients. We get to see the villagers who live around Yesterday's hut, and how their growing fear and resentment make Yesterday and her husband outcasts when it becomes clear that they had AIDS.

Yesterday's only hope is that she will live long enough to see Beauty begin school.  My hope is that growing awareness will make fewer Yesterdays.",Yesterday puts a human face on the African Epidemic,1138492800,17,

Directed by Gary Fleder who honed his craft on such up and coming titles as 'KISS THE GIRLS'-1997 and 'RUNAWAY JURY'-2003 piles on the ominous atmosphere with great set pieces. It also helps that he has a great ensemble of actors along for the ride.  James Franco plays his villainous Gator Bodine role as an intelligent misfit surrounded by a den of backwoods denizens under his drug controlled empire unfortunately the great Clancy Brown has very little to do as the sheriff on the take.  Although Jason Statham is front and center , the excellent screenplay by Sylvester Stallone based on a novel by Chuck Logan lets the female roles outshine the proceedings:  Winona Ryder is wonderful as Franco's motorcycle mama partner looking like she just walked off the set of Kurt Sutter's 'SONS OF ANARCHY'; Kate Bosworth emerges as the films scene stealer as Franco's cokehead sister who sets the plot in motion and unfortunately, Rachelle Lefevre who is shining on the Stephen King television hit 'UNDER THE DOME' goes the way of Clancy Brown as having very little to do as a possible love interest for Statham.  It is Jason's show all the way and thankfully the photography by Theo Van De Sande plays up the snap/crackle violence when it erupts.

Tells the story of professional thief Mackin, played by Alec Baldwin with his usual simmering volcanic brilliance. An associate of one of the crime families, he's been asked to do a fairly simple boost: Help a Detroit thug snatch several million dollars worth of negotiable food stamps. If he doesn't like the set-up he can walk away. If he does the job - he scores a nice payday and the continuing friendship of the mob.

Problem is that the Motor City connection is a devilish funny moron by the name of 'Pointy' Williams, a ghetto thug who has a hilariously warped desire to recast himself as a high society gentleman. But just like many from the upper crust - he doesn't like paying for services rendered. To avoid a $25K payout to the thief, the plan calls for Mackin's death upon completion of the heist, and simultaneously making a much needed payoff to a pair of dirty cops he's using as hitmen.

Not a good idea.

As the hit goes awry, a bloodied and seriously pissed off Mackin decides on retribution plus heavy duty interest. Notoriously, street hoods only rarely accept their mistakes with grace and maturity, and the knuckleheaded versions never walk away. So a war is unleashed; the destruction and blood begins to flow as each side ups the ante until it threatens to engulf everyone and everything.

Despite my description - this is an amusing and entertaining comedy. Admittedly, a very dark comedy, but one that I find particularly ticklish to the funny bone.

Personal Notes:

- Long an underrated actor. Alec is probably one of the best artists around that hasn't accrued nearly the acclaim equal to his talent. Admittedly, he's one of his own worst enemies; the infamous Irish temper often getting the better of him. A reflection that, like the many conflicted characters he portrays, exposes the person underneath isn't too far removed from the roles which he undertakes.

- Generally enjoy Michael Jai White's performances, but in this hilarious role I take particular joy. It takes real skill and genuine talent to play stupid. Not a joke. Almost every single actor has ""diminished capacity"" in their repertoire; it's really not that difficult to play disabled. But very few have 'moron' as a skill, not unless they actually are - like Paris Hilton.

- Probably one of the best, most complete characters, Rebecca De Mornay has done since her breakout role in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Risky-Business/dp/B0018QPPXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Risky Business</a>'. Extraordinarily talented, but unfortunately I think she missed her chance at the brass ring. Still, that's what I thought of Melissa Leo, and she eventually won an Oscar. So...

Timothy Dalton makes his first appearance as James  Bond. Although Roger Moore is and always will be my favourite James Bond, I  like Dalton's dark, Fleming-style approach to the proceedings.

This 1995 film has a bigger budget and more star quality, but the imprint of this director is certainly there.  There's lots of violence - with guns, knives and explosives.  And, like El Mariachi, the characterizations are secondary to the constant action.  It's all very silly, and a little too long at 106 minutes, but I frankly couldn't take my eyes off the screen.

The film stars Antonio Bandaras as the good guy and Salma Hayek as his romantic interest.  There's a cameo performance by Quentin Tarantino and Steve Buscemi has one of the best scenes in the film as he sets up the story at the beginning by his tall tale in a bar.

This is not a film to be taken seriously.  It's targeted to teenage boys and the video game crowd.

So why am I watching this flick and enjoying myself so much?  I guess it's cause I'm just a film buff and am fascinated by the techniques and constant action.

Followed by the two Roy Rogers films BELLS OF SAN ANGELO and UNDER CALIFORNIA STARS. Both shot in Trucolor (a cheap version of Technicolor adopted by Republic) a misnomer if ever there was one.

Of the fifty films on show here we have at the top of the list Roy Rogers (10), Tex Ritter (6) John Wayne (5) Gene Autry (4) Richard Dix (2) Bob Steele (2) and all the rest are solo outings (22)

The five most viewable and interesting films for me here, all shot in black and white, were in release-date order:

BLUE STEEL 1934
An early John Wayne western with an almost serious George ""Gabby"" Hayes as the sheriff and Wayne is the wrongly accused newcomer mistaken for The Polka Dot Bandit who is played by Yakima Canutt who is also responsible for the stunts in the film including John Wayne's All in all a most likable B-Western.

JUDGE PRIEST 1934
A John Ford film starring Will Rogers in the title role as the judge in southern (Confederate) town after the war. Hardly a western at all really, but much to enjoy by this Master Director full of his usual comic touches, still raises a smile some 70 odd years later.

THE OUTLAW 1941 (Released, then withdrawn, limited release again 1943)
Billy-the-Kid is the Outlaw in question played by a young Jack Buetel. But most of the attention in this film was focused on 19 year-old Jane Russell and Director Howard Hughes, and his fixation with her ample bosom from various camera angles.  An interesting A-Western beautifully filmed plus some very clever camera work on the lightening fast gunplay.  Not fully released until 1950 to more sceptic post war audience.

THE KANSAN 1943
Richard Dix (Him of the jutting jaw fame) is elected marshal of a Kansas town, in this A-Western. Directed by George Archainbaud also staring Jane Wyatt and Victor Jory with Albert Dekker as the heavy. Excellent cinematography by Russel Haran raises it above the norm.

MY PAL TRIGGER 1946
Said to be Rogers' own favourite amongst all his movies it also well received by the critics of the day. The story is about Roy being accused of killing a highbred stallion. But not before he has put Roy's mare in foal. The foal is born whilst Roy is in jail. Later he gets to train the young stallion who turns into none other than ""Trigger"". Also starring Dale Evans and George ""Gabby"" Hayes who is once again half-serious.

Although I have seen better transfers of the following black and white westerns they're all at least worth a mention here

1. THE SANTA FE TRAIL 1943. Starring Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan
2. ABILENE TOWN 1946 Starring Randolph Scott and Rhonda Fleming.
3. THE ANGEL AND THE BADMAN 1946 Starring John Wayne with Harry Carey (A John Ford favourite former star) and Gail Russell. Which was John Wayne's first film as Producer and Star!

Finally most of the remaining Rogers and Autry films are okay and well worth viewing, which maybe reflects their bigger budget than the likes of say Tex Ritter etc. My three star rating here had to be repressed due to the dross, which is a great pity, if someone had the sense or care to delete the 50% or so of the rubbish on offer here and left us with the remainder which probably would have readily retailed for the same price or even better.

5.0,False,"11 8, 2007",ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00068NVK2,{'Format:': ' DVD'},Gary F. Taylor,"The script reduces the stage original by approximately two-thirds.  The cinematography is clunky and the production values are weak.  Direction is indifferent and the acting styles are all over the map.  Even so, the 1947 MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA is a startlingly powerful film, a melodrama that leaps and crackles and which will hold the attention of discerning viewers through two and a half hours to its remarkably bitter end.

Loosely based on the ancient Greek tragedy THE ORESTIA, Eugene O'Neill's 1931 drama was and is an extraordinary creation.  Strangely ritualistic in tone and requiring approximately six hours to perform, it stunned audiences upon its debut, was a powerful factor in O'Neill's winning of the Nobel Prize for Literature, and remains one of the great pinacles of American theatre to this day.  It is also a warped, sick, and twisted tale of adultry, incestuous affections, blackmail, murder, and suicide, and as such it held Hollywood at bay for close to twenty years.

The story concerns the Mannons, a family that has dominated a small New England town for more than a hundred years, dominating through social status and supposed family and civic duty even as they conceal several internal scandals.  The film opens with father Ezra (Raymond Massey) away from home, acting as a leader in the Civil War; in his absence wife Christine (Katrina Patinoux) has taken a lover who visits the house under the guise of courting daughter Lavinia (Rosalind Russell.)  When Lavinia discovers the truth, she attempts to blackmail her mother into giving up the relationship--but the attempt backfires into a horrendous cycle of murder and revenge that ultimately destroys the family and drives Lavinia to her her doom.

The script actually does manage to encompass all the primary plot points of O'Neill's original, and although the result is a bit talky in a forced sort of way the story itself possesses a relentless quality that does indeed approximate the stage original.  Even more surprisingly, the script makes no effort to soften the incestuous nature of the various relationships that characterize the tale, relationships that increasingly pervert and twist the family as the story progresses.  This is dark, dark stuff indeed.

As previously noted, the cast is all over the map in terms of acting style and indeed each of the principles seem to be performing for a different film.  Rosalind Russell is distinctly ""classic Hollywood;"" Michael Redgrave is distinctly ""English theatre.""  Katrina Patinoux, a memorable performer, is Greek and therefore somewhat out of place as the matriach of a New England family; Raymond Massey, an equally memorable performer, seems to reprise his earlier portrayal of Abraham Lincoln.  Each and every one of them, in their own different ways, play at white-hot intensity, and many find the resulting mix too uncomfortable.  I myself did not: if anything, I felt it added to and intensified the overall strangeness of the piece.

Eugene O'Neill dramas do not, as a rule, film extremely well: they are too clearly designed for the stage and as such they work best in front of a live audience.  All the same, and in spite of its numerous flaws, this is one of the few film versions of an O'Neill play that actually manages to capture the intensity of the stage original.  Dark, brooding, and deeply disturbing, MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA deserves a great deal more attention than it has ever received.

When the film failed at the box office, RKO responded by cutting it in re-release.  This Image Entertainment DVD restores those cuts, and that is a very good thing indeed.  Unfortunately, it is also the only good thing that one can say for the DVD.  The print quality is at best mediocre, a bit fuzzy, occasionally streaked, and riddled with artifacts.  There are no extras of any kind.  But just as the film transcends its own flaws, so too does it transcends this poor transfer.  Strongly recommended.

2.0,False,"09 11, 2011",A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00004REJJ,{'Format:': ' DVD'},Lonnie E. Holder,"This movie begins with some promise.  A couple of girls are wandering through an oasis.  We see close-ups of their behinds trying to sneak out from under their shorts.  The next thing you know, it is zombie feast time!  Then we see a flashback to World War II.  Germans travel to the same oasis.  Allies are hiding at the Oasis.  We see a big battle.  We see lots of shooting and blood and other war related stuff.  The director had an array of actual armored vehicles, which impressed me.

We move into the future and see the former German commander dying and suddenly everyone is after Nazi gold left by the Germans.  There is only one minor obstacle.  Nazi zombies are guarding the gold!

From this point forward, this movie is a lot like watching someone grind meat.  Only instead of stuffing the meat into the grinder, they very slowly move the meat toward the grinder, and then they very slowly stuff it into the grinder.  Yes, this movie is much like the awful B-movies of yore where everyone is in great physical shape and can run like the wind, yet the slow, shambling zombies with various body parts in various states of decay always manage to catch up to them.

Since this movie is European (I am unsure whether there was a particular country involved; the beginning said Eurocine), there has to be at least some nudity, and there is.  We see some brief nudity in the desert and then there is a somewhat torrid love scene.  I was thinking that zombies might eat the two lovers during the love scene.  I leave you to learn whether they did.

Before I forget, one line from this movie is highly memorable.  Near the end of the movie the zombies are attacking a group of college students (have you ever noticed how frequently college students manage to get themselves into these situations?), and one of them brilliantly says something along the line of ""Let's get some bottles and make Molotov cocktails, like in school.""  I am wondering what kind of school these kids attended.

There are some good scenes in this movie.  Considering that the zombie makeup alternated between some junk slapped on faces and full masks, the zombies looked okay too.  The problem remains that a dozen or so slow, shambling zombies managed to ""sneak"" up on healthy young adults and have people sashimi.  Another problem is that group after group go into the oasis, none of them getting the hint that the oasis has a zombie problem.  Many horror movies seem to work only because people keep denying the obvious until something bites, claws, stabs, eats, etc., them.  I should also point out that the movie drags a lot too.  I guess the naked women were in there because the director was running out of victims to feed the zombies.

Unfortunately, the few good or interesting scenes in this movie are unable to overcome the boring scenes and the general silliness of creeping zombies ""chasing"" people and catching them.  The plot has more than a few holes in it.  I know, you cannot expect Shakespeare in a horror movie, but at least some coherence and excitement would be good.  This movie gets two stars because there are a few interesting scenes.  Otherwise, this movie would be a one star movie.

If you are a huge zombie movie fan, this one might be for you.  Otherwise, I am unable to figure out who might like this movie.  Therefore, I can only wish you...

Keep in mind that the event was edited down to two hours however since I saw the live PPV replay & not the tape version, I don't know which matches were edited.

Z-Man vs. Mike Rotundo - Just an average opener, nothing more or less.

""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams & Midnight Express vs. Samoan Swat Team & Samoan Savage - This was a real fun match to watch as all four men here meshed well to bring forth a good match.  The story behind this match was mostly to put over Dr. Death as he completely dominated the Samoans whenever he was in the ring while the Somoans would gain control whenever the Express was in the ring.

Tommy Rich vs. Cuban Assassian - Same as the opening match, there wasn't anything special or noteworthy here.

NWA Tag Team Champions Fabulous Freebirds vs. Dynamic Dudes - The match itself was a solid match from top to bottom but the one thing that was more noticeable than anything else in the match was how the Freebirds were loudly being cheered despite being heels since the audience didn't buy into the ""surfer"" gimmick the Dudes had at the time.

Steiner Brothers vs. Doom - This was the debut of Ron Simmons & Butch Reed as the team of Doom, who were masked at the time.  This was tag team wrestling 101 as Doom looked very impressive as a team here by double teaming behind the referee's back, suspension for Scott Steiner to finally make a tag after getting beat on for minutes.  Good first match in their series of matches.

United States Champion Lex Luger vs. Brian Pillman - This was one of those matches that gives Luger his reputation of being a bad wrestler because Pillman completely carried this match.  Brian dominated a majority of the match with his mix of high flyin' moves & mat wrestling.  He worked on Luger's shoulder with the story being that he was tryin' to keep Luger off his feet thoughout the match which dominated.  Luger was on the defense most of the time & his offense consisted of punches,  kicks, and clotheslines whenever he was in control.  Luger got the win in the end off Brian making a big mistake but for the most part, this was a Brian Pillman exibition match.
(Also available on ""Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon"" DVD)

Road Warriors vs. Skyscrapers - Unlike the Steiners/Doom match, this was perfectly fits the ""irresistable force meets the inamovable object"" as this was a stiff match with both teams trying to outpower each other thoughout the match.  This was a good match to watch as this was the most athletic performance I've ever seen from Sid Vicious in his career as the best performance I've ever seen from Dan Spivey.

Thunderdome Cage Match w/special referee - Bruno Sammartino: Ric Flair & Sting w/Ole Anderson vs. Terry Funk & Great Muta w/Gary Hart - The rules for this match was that Ole Anderson or Gary Hart had to throw in the towel for their team for the match to end.  This also used the Thundercage structure that was WCW's version of Hell In A Cell that not only covered the ring but the outside area as well.  This match started out as a regular tag match but evolved into a four man brawl with each man using the cage at one point or another.  Some ""highlight moments"" to look out for was Sting & Flair at various times using the rope that was the in the top corner of the cage to swing onto Terry Funk like ""Tarzan"" and Sting doing a huge leap splash from that same top corner of the cage all the way into the middle of the ring.  The match was wild (the usual with Terry Funk matches) and truely one of the best matches held inside the Thundercage structure.

What I got out of the movie wasn't so much that wall streeters were to blame; more so I think the filmmaker suggests that these behaviors are a societal or global issue that needs attention by everyone.  One of the characters justifies it through a human nature argument, which was interesting, that people can't help but be who they are.  My favorite part of the movie is probably when Paul Bettany's character is talking to the guy that's going to be fired.

Hayek's Frida is a woman with big dreams who is down-to-earth enough to figure out that bringing her dreams to fruition involves hard work and knowing the right people. When she realizes she might have talent as an Artist, she demands of Diego Rivera, the most famous of Mexican painters at the time, to know the truth: tell me if I am wasting my time painting, tell me the truth, she says. Rivera encourages her in her art and before long they become lovers, though Rivera is much older and a big mountain of a man prone to womanize, yet obviously in love with Frida.
The visuals are awe-inspiring, which comes as no surprise to anyone who knows Taymor's previous work in ""Titus"" and ""The Lion King."" But here, Taymor takes her vision one step further by bringing many of Frida's paintings to life by presenting them as tableaux vivantes.
Much is made of the political climate in Mexico at the time (1920's) and many famous people (Nelson Rockefeller, for one) are trotted out, but it is the relationship of Frida and Diego that is at the core of this film. Hayek and Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera are fascinating to watch and accomplish something that is very difficult: they make living, breathing, feeling human beings of these historical figures. Not an easy task.
""Frida"" is as beautiful as a Kahlo painting, but more importantly there is an over-riding intelligence coupled with a voluptuous sensuality at work here that is hard not to appreciate and admire.",Magical Realism,1042934400,2,

This is Led Zeppelin's much loved and much criticized performances pieced together from three Madison Square Garden Shows at the end of their record breaking 1973 tour. I have always had a love hate relationship with this show as its not Led Zeppelin at its best yet like all Led Zeppelin shows has some great moments. There is great interplay and improvisation in No Quarter and Dazed and Confused which for me personally are my favorite live versions of these songs. On the other hand you have a raw and weak voiced Robert Plant and shoddy camera work which left gaps in song which required fantasy sequences by all the members which are both funny and tedious. Yet I bought the 2DVD re-mastered version and was it worth it you ask?

Yes it was. The re-mastering job by Page was phenominal. The audio is much more vibrant and crisper. John Bonham's prototype kick drum gets the sound it deserves and Page's leads and solos can be heard in all their fiery glory. Even Plant who is the weak point of this show sounds better and not so raw throat sounding. Let us not forget John Paul Jones the unsung hero of the band whose marvelous bass sound comes through much better and No Quarter is my favorite part of this movie and his fantasy sequence certainly matches up well with the song. Other highlights include getting to hear Over the Hills and Far Away for the first time  and seeing Celebration Day played live on the DVD. Page's violin solo is fantastic and turned up loud in 5.1 is smoking.

The Song Remains the Same is Led Zeppelin at its best and worst yet vital to the Zeppelin catalogue and a must for fans. Get it for the superb re-mastering and picture. I was really let down when I first watched this having heard all of Led Zeppelin's albums as a 16 year old kid in 1990 yet at 33 I feel this movie got a much deserved make over which I enjoyed. If you want Led Zeppelin at its best get the 2DVD set Led Zeppelin. If you enjoy the self indulgence of 1970's Rock and Roll then The Song Remains the Same is the epitome of those times. Led Zeppelin has brought so much joy to my life that other than my wife I could never imagine a day without this passionate band and the timeless music.

makes it so horrific is that it is based on true

off the gruesome antics of a psychotic killer Anthony

scared the hell out of me.

Having a score by Irving Berlin is on the same scale as having John Williams manage the music. There are many great songs heard throughout this movie. While older people may appreciate these a bit more, the younger generation would also benefit from the songs.

Actually it wasn't ALL bad.  Despite the rather predictable way to begin the horror movie with a man and woman freshly married driving along some back road late at night and running over a woman, the storyline actually got a lot better and kept my interest soon after this point.

In fact, the story improved so much that I really don't think all the negative reviews Shutter has received so far are appropriate.

As far as being scared goes, I wasn't feeling much fear in the beginning up until the woman gets on the subway train and sees a scary looking image in the window.  THIS is when the story really gets going and the fear increases significantly.

The entire movie had a feel very similar to the Ring with a dark and eerie setting, and the pacing is similar as well as far as the whole mystery approach goes.  Since I consider the Ring one of the best horror movies in the last 10 years or so, I thought this movie did a pretty decent job of capturing a similar vibe.

Also, the focus on taking pictures and seeing ghostly images in the pictures was done VERY well because the ghosts usually appear in places that aren't so predictable in the photo.

This list of 50 includes some of the greatest movies of all time - Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, The Lion King, and 101 Dalmations.  Unfortunately, Disney studios has ceded the animation mantle to Pixar, and their last 10 films cannot hold a candle to the likes of Toy Story and The Incredibles.  So I was expecting, for the 50th film, a better effort, especially with John Lassiter as producer.  While Tangled does not quite live up to its more distant predecessors, it at least is an enjoyable 90 minutes, and it does contain some very nice animation and some big laughs.  It is also likely to be remembered as an ""also ran"" when compared to Disney's other release of 2010, Toy Story 3, which won an Oscar and set the box office record for most successful animated film of all time.

Tangled is an adaptation of the Rapunzel story, elaborating and making Rapunzel's hair the fountain of youth (it's not as absurd as it sounds!).  I suppose that explains how she can drag it through meadows, rivers, and forests and never get it dirty.....  Unfortunately for Rapunzel, the hair needs to be attached to her head for it to work its magic, therefore she is held prisoner in the tower to satisfy the selfish needs of her adoptive mother, Gotha.  A thief named Ryder, fleeing from his latest caper, uses Rapunzel's tower as a hiding place, and their meeting sets in motion a chain of events involving Rapunzel and Ryder travelling to the royal city, pursued by the local constabulary, Ryder's disgruntled henchmen, and Rapunzel's ""mother"".

Ryder's quipping asides generate many laughs, as do the antics of Maximus, a horse from the city guard that goes beyond the call of duty in trying to bring Ryder to justice.  There is also the joy of a remarkable action set-piece involving a breaking dam that is (dare I say it?) astonishing in it's animation (akin to the scale of Mulan's avalanche or the Lion King's stampede).  There is also the usual cast of Disney minor characters to lend colour and fun to the proceedings.  Certainly children will enjoy it, male or female, at least, if my 2 sons (5 and 3) and their female cousin (5) are any indication.  And it's ultimately harmless, certainly there are no traumatizing moments like Mufasa's death, and the violence is FAR less than that seen in The Incredibles or even Sleeping Beauty.

But it doesn't quite all add up to a classic film.  I think the problem lies in the backstory - Rapunzel is kidnapped by Gotha from her parents, but there is no emotion in their plight because no time is spent in developing their characters or any relationship with their daughter.  By contrast, King Stephan has a prolonged scene in the middle of Sleeping Beauty, Mufasa teaches Simba and plays with him in the Lion King, and Belle's sacrifice for her father in Beauty and the Beast is not taken until after a number of establishing scenes showing Maurice by himself and with Belle.  Thus the reunion in Tangled has no particular emotion in it.  The second problem is with the music - there are a number of songs by Alan Menken (with lyricist Glenn Slater), but they sound like they belong in a Saturday afternoon teenage sitcom on the Disney Channel (e.g. ""When Will My Life Begin"" and ""I See the Light""). True, ""I've Got a Dream"" is a joyous setpiece to rival ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"" or ""Under the Sea"", but one song does not a musical make.  Finally, I would be remiss if I neglected to point out that this is not a good value-for-money DVD.  Considering I paid the same price for Toy Story 3 and Tangled, the former has a number of neat extras, including a featurette on Pixar's modelling process, various short tours of Pixar's studio, and footage of a Buzz action figure on the International Space Station.  All Tangled has is footage on an alternate beginning which, while interesting, is paltry indeed compared to most Disney releases.  (of course, the intended audience will not care one whit that the DVD has no extras....)

Overall, I'd place Tangled in with the likes of lesser (but still enjoyable) films such as Atlantis, Hunchback of Notre Dame, or Pocahontas (but better than The Rescuers or Tarzan).  And it's certainly better than most other animation out there that passes for children's entertainment, such as Will Farrell's Curious George, the Rugrats Movie, the Clone Wars film, and even Pixar's A Bug's Life.",A middling Disney film on a bargain-basement DVD,1305072000,,

Director Hany Abu-Assad, who is a Muslim was born in Nazareth, which is a largely Christian city in Palestine.  He moved to the Netherlands when he was a young man and currently lives in Los Angeles.  He believes the film presents ""an artistic point of view of...[a] political issue.""

I tend to agree.  The proof perhaps is in the fact that some Palestinians feel the film wasn't fair to their situation while some Israelis feel that the film glorified suicide bombers.  Both sides can find evidence in the film to support their point of view, and the arguments can become heated.

Personally I find suicide bombings abhorrent and counterproductive.  My belief has long been that the Palestinians would further their cause through a non-violent approach similar to methods used by Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.  Using your children to kill other people's children while committing suicide is not only morally wrong, but not likely to win the hearts and minds of people who can help you.  Furthermore the idea (expressed in the film by the suicide bombers and those who exploit them) that some people are superior because they are not afraid to die demonstrates a limited understanding of human nature and ignores history.  The Japanese used suicide bombers in World War II for example to no good effect.  And those men were not the ""humiliated"" and ""oppressed"" uneducated youths typical of suicide bombers in the Middle East.  Instead some of them were the cream of the young manhood of a growing nation.  Understand also that if the United States had the need it would have no trouble persuading countless Americans to commit suicide for God and country.  Some of the combat missions in the Pacific Theater amounted to something close to suicide.  No single people have a monopoly on tribalism.

What Hany Abu-Assad shows in the film is that the justification for suicide bombing is at best suspect and at worse without any merit at all.  ""What happens afterward?"" one of the bombers asks, and is told, ""Two angels come and pick you up.""  This is not merely satire, it is a burlesque of the ""Paradise Now"" reasoning.  Indeed the title of the film is itself satirical and ironic.  Young men seeing this film will notice that it is THEY who are being used as suicide bombers, not the political leaders and the imams.  Also the scene in which the suicide bombers make the obligatory video saying goodbye to family and friends and ""I did it for God"" with automatic rifle held on high, was played as farce, revealing the empty promise behind being used.

The fact that most of the anti-suicide rhetoric in the film comes from Suha (Lubna Azabal) who is the daughter of a privileged Arab and onetime opposition hero is seen as significant by some because in Arab/Muslim countries the political opinion of women is of scant value, and therefore Suha is seen as expressing a minority or discredited opinion.  However, since her expression is so very well articulated and persuasive, it can be seen from the opposite point of view, as expressing reason and moral truth.

Hany Abu-Assad of course had more than an artistic intent in making this film.  Clearly he wanted to put the tragedy of the Palestinians upon the silver screen (and DVD) for all the world to see.  To be effective he realized that he could not poison the waters of his expression with subjectivity and one-sidedness.  He had to work hard to be as objective as possible and to present both sides of the argument.  That way his film would be viewed and discussed, and some sympathy and understanding might develop.  He had to show suicide bombers as living, breathing human beings.  Notice that the two depicted are relatively intelligent young men, not mindless robots.

I share with Abu-Assad the belief that if all the facts about what is happening in the Middle East become widely known and understood (in so far as it is possible to understand the lives of people living in different cultures thousands of miles away) this knowledge and understanding would help to bring about positive change.  Ignorance is our only real enemy.

In short, Paradise Now is a work of art and an excellent film that clearly deserved its Golden Globe Award as the Best Foreign Film and its nomination for an Oscar as Best Foreign Film.  Kais Nashif who plays Said, one of the bombers, and Ali Suliman, who plays the other, both do an outstanding job, particularly Nashif who manages to combine the look and feel of a disadvantaged youth with the strength of character of a young man who is determined to follow what he ultimately determines is his fate.  His motivation goes beyond the ignorant and indoctrinated suicide bomber who is hoping to be rewarded with virgins in heaven.  He has personal reasons for becoming a suicide bomber.  He is the son of a man who collaborated with the Israelis, and consequently he feels that his fate is to compensate for what his father did.

The film was shot in Nablus and Nazareth and captures some of the atmosphere.  The editing is crisp and the story unfolds clearly with a nice tension.  The sense that the bomb around the bomber's waist could go off at any moment is one of the devices in the film that maintains that tension in a unique way.

All in all this a film very much worth seeing regardless of how you feel about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.",Very much worth seeing regardless of your POV,1173484800,9,

I was wary about the changes they made, as written on the back on the blu-ray case. The verdict: Excellent picture, but the 3D animation enhancements they put in sink it. And it's not so much that I'm against CG enhancements; it's that the CG is cheap and cartoony! What I would expect in the opening crawl of your standard PS3 game, not a motion picture. The opening titles with the fast moving numbers (one of many things that influenced The Matrix) have been replaced by the background menu of a PS3 player, from the looks of it. It's one of many graphics changes. And yet, I could almost forgive all the background changes - except they chose to re-animate in CG our main character (Major Motoko Kusanagi) in two major sequences that are distracting beyond belief! The original filmmakers names are still on this; I don't know how they could think this would look any good, cutting from fake-looking 3D animation back to cell animation in the same scene. The 3D elements in the sequel, Innocence, look better by comparison; likely because it was planned that way.

One blu-ray bonus is that the original version of GITS is in the special features. But I swear they made it look grainy and dirty on purpose (like it was captured off laserdisc or something), just to make 2.0 look like the better, true version. My DVD of GITS looks much better, in comparison to this transfer.

This film succeeds beautifully as an allegory of life. Despite the crazy train setup, it isn't science fiction at all.  It isn't even about the future.  It's about the human condition in life, the myriad ways humans find to destroy themselves, each other and the world to gain power or to protect what they have.  It's about the repetition throughout thousands of years of the same sickening methods of doing so. And yet it is all we have.  Like life, the train goes forward one way or the other.  Why are we here and why is it like this?  Who made it all?  Why does it all lead to death?  All of this is summed up in Curtis' eyes once he learns what is in the front car.

5.0,False,"07 16, 2013",A3TD7HLTDWZ382,B00A6UHC0U,{'Format:': ' Blu-ray'},Pikminfan,"I'll say up front, though it bears little resemblance to the monster sized dump that is Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" trilogy-Pacific Rim is the type of movie Bayformers should have been.  What I mean by that-is that unlike those hell spawned abominations-Pacific Rim delivers giant robots that awe and inspire instead of ones that pee on people and dangle metallic testicles.  Also unlike Bayformers you will not be forced to witness any dog humping or have to groan through lame ""jokes"" about red mugs in yellow rooms.  (No 45 minute long who-gives-a-crap job interview scenes in here either)

  Thankfully-Pacific Rim does not take an uber-cool property and twist it, turn it and crush it beyond recognition into some overly long, lame one-note joke of a film.  Instead, it's completely earnest and non cynical in its delivery.  I've been a fan of Guillermo Del Toro since Pan's Labyrinth (a BRILLIANT adult fairy tale) and have gone back and watched his other films to discover what a true master of the art he really is.  I went into Pacific Rim with realistic expectations-daring to hope that it would be the movie I wanted it to be.  I left the theater transformed into a little boy filled with wonder and amazement at what I had just witnessed.  Though this film is jam packed with special effects-they serve to add to the story not to take away from it or go unnecessarily over the top (I'm looking at you Man of Steel...).

  The Jaegers here are a marvel to behold and easy on the eyes (unlike the overcomplicated designs of the Bayformers).  The sense of scale and power they inspire is awe striking and the Jaegers are beautifully designed in every way.  In fact, the whole movie (praise to the art director) is incredibly consistent in its design-whisking us far away from the real world into the candy colored Kaiju vs. Jaeger world of the future which is EXACTLY what a good movie SHOULD do.  This film takes special effects far beyond mere gimmickry and serves them up as colorful and artistic as possible.  Even if Pacific Rim is not your kind of movie, you can't help but to be blown away by how beautiful it all is.  While the story here may not be Oscar-worthy, it's still very sound and interesting and the characters (mostly unknown actors) are very likable.  Idris Elba is good in everything he does and his role here is no different.  Charlie Hunnam also brings a lot of charisma to the protagonist.  In short, Pacific Rim is a well meaning film that knows EXACTLY what kind of film it is and it aims right for the heart of the little boy inside us all.  For me, it brought back that sense of wonder and awe my adult self had forgotten movies were still capable of delivering.  I really enjoyed playing in Guillermo Del Toro's sand box.  Pacific Rim is a monsters vs. robots smash fest and it's completely unapologetic about being exactly that.  Do yourself a favor and give Pacific Rim a look.  See it in the theater if you can for the sheer sense of scale.  Fathers take your sons to see this film too.  If movies like this continue to flounder at the box office, it's a guarantee that original ideas will cease to exist and the summer box office season will be bloated with more sequels, spin offs, reboots, etc.  Del Toro nailed this one, it's the movie his career has been building up to.

Released almost a decade after the event, the film depicts a fictional account of the immediate events following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.

The main plot focuses on the differing views in how to deal with the death of Diana. The Royal Family, while on their summer residence at Balmoral Castle, sees her death as a private affair, not to be treated as an official Royal death, in contrast with newly appointed Prime Minister Tony Blair and Diana's ex-husband Prince Charles, who attempt to reflect the public wish for an official expression of grief. Matters are further complicated by the media, royal protocol regarding Diana's official status, and wider issues about republicanism.

Full of wit, humor, and pathos, this moving portrait of the British royals during the period after Princess Diana's death features not one but two remarkable performances, that of Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II and Michael Sheen as the newly-ordained Prime Minister Tony Blair. They embody their characters and lay bare the motivations behind these prominent people, giving viewers a glimpse into the inner workings of the British monarchy.

The setup:  Many years ago, in the town of Darkness Falls (yeah, right, a town is going to name itself THAT!!!), a rich, kindly elderly woman gave money to children who came to her with their missing teeth...earned nickname ""Tooth Fairy.""  Later, woman is horribly disfigured in a fire, and is seldom seen, and if she is, she's wearing a porcelain mask.  When some kids go missing, the Tooth Fairy is blamed and promptly lynched by the town, who, as the ultimate humiliation, also tear off her mask, exposing her horrible injuried for the world to see.  Later, the children are found safe and sound, but by then, she has cursed the children of Darkness Falls.  If, when she comes to collect their last tooth, a child sees the Tooth Fairy, they will be killed, unless they always stay in the light.  She hates that light, see.
Oh my.  But even if one accepts the silliness of this device, perhaps we'll get some decent chills along the way?  Well, no.  We first meet our lead character, whose name I don't remember a mere hour after enduring the movie, when he manages to see the Tooth Fairy as a child.  His mother is killed and he is blamed (for NO good reason) and taken to an asylum, where he spends some amount of years hiding in the light and having a hard time sleeping...you'd think you might get used to sleeping with some lights on, but what do I know?
Years later, another boy is in the same situation, only this time, his much older sister (who happens to be the lead characters' long-ago sweetheart) drags our lead character back to Darkness Falls to ""help"" her troubled younger brother.  Naturally, no one believes these two sufferers of the tooth fairy curse, but everywhere they go, the tooth fairy swoops down and takes another victim.
The movie is PG-13, so the killings are pretty tame, and pretty much the same.  Tooth Fairy can sorta fly, so she usually drops on her victim and then up into the air with them she goes.  Naturally it's always dark when she does this, so we don't see any of it very clearly.  But no one cares anyway.
At one point in the movie, we meet our adult male lead, now living far away from Darkness Falls, and we see that he's got drawings all over his wall of a porcelain faced figure.  When he sees that the little boy has also drawn a similar figure, he apparently decides to make it his life's mission to save the boy.  What is it in horror movies that the hero so often draws sketches of the ""horrible"" thing they've seen.  If I saw something horrible, I wouldn't be able to sketch it...can't draw worth a hill of beans.  Or maybe being scared would make me artistic?  Or maybe only artistic people get scared?  This is such a cliche, and in this film, if falls even flatter than usual.
Mostly the movie involves every one running around, trying to stay in light and shooting guns at her...to no effect.  Nearly everyone dies and we, the viewer, are unable to muster up even one ounce of concern or caring.  The movie generates not one smidgen of tension.  And there is no humor, either...it takes itself VERY seriously. Everyone involved in the movie:  director, screenwriter, actors (all unknown to me), cinematograher, editor, scorer have NO business in show business!!!
(The only worse horror I have seen is FEAR DOT COM, which is equally incompetent, but I hate even more because some of the cast members are actually good actors (usually) and because the movie is so ICKY.)

  They were.

  It was even worse than I'd imagined.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  For the most part, the X-Men movie franchise has been good to us. Somehow, FOX Studios and Marvel had created a movie brand that not only appeased the old comic-book lovers of the franchise, but was also able to draw in new blood. Everybody liked X-Men. The franchise had gotten so big that prime-time television is on its third season of a hit spin-off, Heroes. They drew in so much new blood that they started releasing new comic-book spin-offs of the X-Men, and everyone and their grandmother bought them.

  Hey, I'm not complaining. I enjoyed the ride.

  Then, they got greedy. The producers decided to ""go back in time"" to explain the origins of Wolverine. It wasn't a bad idea. Out of all the X-Men, both heroes and villians, Wolverine's back-story is probably the most interesting, aside from Angel/Archangel, and even Jubilee(who's surrounding story of The Reavers is much more interesting than the character herself. Excuse me, my dorkiness is showing.)

  Unfortunately, the producers didn't feel the same way, and decided to ""Hollywood it up"" into the piece of drek in theatres today.

  I cannot blame the actors. Across the board, I had no complaints. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine efficiently. He still has that angst-ridden animal nature working for him. Liev Schreiber recasts Victor Creed(aka Sabretooth) well, although he bounces around a little too much like ""a cat."" Ryan Reynolds surprised me with the brief time he was on-screen as Wade Wilson(before becoming Deadpool). All his lines had a bit of dry comical wit, just like the Deadpool I enjoyed reading back when I read comic books. I can't imagine anyone doing a better job. Except maybe Jason Lee(from My Name is Earl, Mallrats, etc.) I even enjoyed Dominic Monaghan's(of LOST and Lord of the Rings fame) short stint as the fearful technolith, Bolt, and Kevin Durand's Blob. Unfortunately, these latter three characters barely had any screen time. They could only do as much as the script, and a last minute rewrite, allowed them to do.

  A major problem seemed to be script and directing. The movie's intro was a huge step away from the end of the original X-Men trilogy. Instead of the dark drama, that coincided with the death of Scott Summers and the rise of the Dark Phoenix, continuing, the franchise reverted back to comic-book goofiness, where action drives the story and character development plays second fiddle. That wouldn't be so bad, except that the action is sparse, too. Having Wolverine and Sabretooth run through 4 wars is a nice idea, but looks way too forced on-screen as an intro. It is continued with a short government task force stint, a lot of walking around and lumber-jacking, until finally Wolverine receives his adamantium infusion. And the story gets worse from there, until the final fight with Deadpool himself, which is a travesty to anyone who enjoyed the ""merc with a mouth.""

  Another thing that bothered me, however small, was the depiction of Wolverine's claws. I remember the past movies having some decent looking claws coming out of Hugh Jackman's fists.

As for the old ones, I liked the eerie backgrounds that pervaded the movies.  I liked the newer version for more instances of comedy.

The story in the new version was good:  a murderer who wants to take over the world feigns his own death and plots his takeover, starting with the British Parliament.

While the movie was entertaining, I thought it lasted a few more minutes than necessary.  Perhaps around 1.5 - 1.75 hours instead of just over 2 hours.

Thought Robert Downey Jr.  did a good job in the Holmes role.  Jude Law was okay as Dr. Watson.

I do look forward to a sequel if that happens - one is hinted with the mysterious appearance of Professor Moriarity.

We'll see.

I give ""Sherlock Holmes"" 3 stars based on the plot, comedy, and action.  Would like to see more of the eerie and mysterious settings from the old Basil Rathbone movies.

HANSSEN,"This, by far, is my favorite Steven Spielberg movie and is absolutely one of my favorite films out of the entire history of cinema.  This is one that could be enjoyed even by those who hate science fiction films.  The plot is amazing and, in my opinion, this film needs to be regarded as the standard setting sci-fi film of the 70's, just as 2001: A Space Odyssey was in the 60's.  Also, the acting was just astounding, especially on the part of Richard Dreyfus.

In conclusion I wanted to add in response to the reviewer below that it is more like good riddance to a witch of a wife.  Teri Garr did a splendid job of playing a wife who's head was completely in the sand and was not supportive of her husband at all.  I mean, if I had a loser wife like this, then I would be really tempted, alien encounter or not, to trash my living room and build a replica of Devil's Tower in my living room so she would think I was crazy and would leave me... FOR GOOD!!  Or, better yet, have the aliens abduct her, harvest her organs so they could see what a LOUSY EARTHLING WIFE IS MADE OF!!

THE GOOD-It contains some of the best episodes from the series' glory years of 1972-76. These contain episodes such as ""Lying,"" Playing Hookey,"" ""Creativity"" ""Moving,"" (my all time favorite), etc. These episodes did have messages, but were filled with genuine humor (some of it based directly from Bill Cosby's 1960s routines that inspired this show in the first place, such as TONSILS, CHICKEN HEART, BUCK BUCK, etc.), a likeable cast, and best of all the music of the Junk Yard Band (for those who don't know-this was where Albert & co. ended episodes where they sang soulful songs about the theme of the story and played junkyard objects as musical instruments). Classic, classic! The response in reviews from both blacks and whites who enjoyed these as children proved that Bill Cosby's expereiment was a success in teaching tolerance and good behavior through ""edutainment.""

THE BAD-The post 1979 episodes. This replaced the wonderful junkyard band segments with a corny bit called ""The Brown Hornet"" which was a really stupid superhero takeoff that one would be hard pressed to crack a smile at viewing. These episodes ere also strong on preaching, but short on entertainment or even convincing performances. If you can sit through ""hard core"" (an anti-pornography piece) or the episode about the kid who finds the gun, you deserve a medal and have a cast-iron stomach.

THE UGLY-See above.

Overall, this is good for the FA episodes before they ""jumped the shark"" in 1979. The rest of this is frisbee material. I ould strongly recommend Fat Albert fans and lovers of good animation to check FAT ALBERT-THE ORIGINAL ANIMATED SERIES VOL.1. This contains the glory days of the series first season and a CD of the Junkyard Band tunes. Now THAT'S a real treat!

Only thing that needs to be done is to get the 1969 debut ""Hey Hey Hey It's Fat Albert"" and the 1970 special ""Weird Harold"" (the latter based on Cosby's classic GO CARTS routine from ""Wonderfulness"") that proceeded this series on DVD and the ""Albertology"" will be complete.","Hey Hey Hey, only some are Okay",1107129600,15,

The film has an outstanding screenplay which will keep you hooked. I found myself missing the film long after and still try to recall scenes for strength. The soundtrack seemed ordinary at first but when I heard it again, I found some solace in its sweet melody. This is one of the year's best films and we all know 2013 was a knockout year that kept on surprising us with drama upon drama. Llewyn Davis has everything, it has a steady visit, some grounding music, beautiful sets and scenes,  a cute cat, a strange lady who doesn't know who's baby she is carrying, some hilarious scenes and LLEWYN DAVIS of course.

Apparently the director and editor of this production did not. Jump cuts and shaky footage can be useful for effect and to make visual points and are great when they are used sparingly. But when not a single shot lasts more than 3 seconds and there are jarring zooms and pans in them...You get a mess. We have split screens. Super imposed shots. Quick shot of Bono's shoes to a quick shot of the back of Larry's head. Those things work in a 4-5 minute song video..But a live concert has to take you there. I think of New Years day at Red Rocks. I think of Exit in Rattle and Hum. I think of Origin of Species in U23D as amazing moments of u2 on video.

Leni & Andrea-The two undress and become nude in front of two hot air balloons.

J.J.-She strips and become nude in a stream.

Angela & J. C.-One is the artist and the other is the nude model. The model quickly undresses the artist and the two quickly fondle each other.

Adapting Philip Pullman's novel proved to be a daunting task and though much of the more controversial subject matter within the plot has been omitted, the film is fairly faithful to the conceit of the book. But the film suffers from a lack of thematic depth, which can be attributed to the removal of the book's religious and political commentary.
It should also be noted that the film ends in an abrupt and emotionally unsatisfying manner. Apparently this is because the studio was not confident that the film would be successful and they didn't wish to end the film with a cliffhanger.

The story, which is set in a universe parallel to our own where people's souls take on the physical form of animals called dmons, follows a feisty and rebellious young girl named Lyra Belacqua, an orphan who lives at Jordon College in England. After a series of widespread kidnappings Lyra half-jokingly promises to rescue her best friend Roger if he is ever kidnapped. Little does she suspect that such a thing will actually happen.
When Lyra's uncle, Lord Asriel, makes a visit to the college to announce a startling discovery in the Far North, Lyra has no idea of the far-reaching implications. Lord Asriel has discovered a connection between the mystical substance Dust and the divisions that separate parallel worlds. This controversial revelation places both he and Lyra under the watchful eye of the Magisterium, a vast totalitarian government, which uses religion to subjugate the masses. But all is changed when the beautiful and authoritative Mrs. Coulter invites Lyra to join her at her home and then journey with her to the Far North.
Before her departure, Lyra is given a tremendous gift from the Master of the College, who bestows unto her an alethiometer (or Golden Compass). The alethiometer has the power to tell the truth to anyone who can read its symbols.
At first Lyra relishes the attention and the luxuries that Mrs. Coulter showers upon her, but then Lyra begins to see a controlling, manipulative side to her new guardian. One night Lyra and her dmon Pan come across a list of children's names and to her shock, she finds Roger's name is on the list. She then realizes that Mrs. Coulter is behind the kidnappings. Lyra runs away, but she is pursued by sinister agents. Luckily she is rescued by Gyptians, a nomadic people, who are seeking revenge on the Magisterium.
Learning to read the alethiometer, Lyra soon realizes that a great destiny is set upon her. She meets and befriends an Armoured Bear named Iorek Byrnison, a beautiful witch named Serafina Pekkala, and an aeronaut named Lee Scoresby. Lyra continues her travels north, and along with her new allies, overcomes many perils including savage Armoured Bears, and soldiers.
Yet nothing can prepare Lyra for what she finds in the Far North. There she learns what became of the kidnapped children and the horrible truth about Mrs. Coulter. In the end Lyra and her companions must face the power of the Magisterium, and either succeed in freeing their world and all others from its tyrannical grasp or die trying.

The film features a spectacular cast including Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra, Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Coulter, Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel, Sam Elliott as Lee Scoresby, and Eva Green as Serafina Pekkala. The film also features Christopher Lee, Derek Jacobi, and the voices of Ian McKellen, Freddie Highmore, and Kathy Bates. The entire cast is superb especially the young Dakota Blue Richards, whose portrayal of plucky heroine Lyra has unfairly been overlooked by most critics.
The Golden Compass, which is the first part in a trilogy, failed to become a hit in the U.S., so it's questionable whether or not the next two books in the series shall ever be adapted into films. Sadly, this means that the adventures of Lyra (at least cinematically) are left without an ending. This certainly detracts from the enjoyment of watching the film, but perhaps there is still hope that the next two books will be given a cinematic treatment and thus provide viewers with a sense of closure.
It's unfortunate that the film was a Box office disappointment and that we may never find out how Lyra's adventures come to their end, but there are reasons for the film's poor reception from audiences. One of those reasons is New Line's overly ambitious and foolhardy marketing strategy. In the very first trailer they dared to make a comparison between this film and the beloved&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-Trilogy/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</a>. This in itself was like committing Box Office suicide. Another reason for the film's failure to attract large audiences is the controversial thematic materials of the books. A major theme of Philip Pullman's books is that of rebelling against authority and religious dogma. Cleverly (and some would say subversively) exploiting taboos within Judaeo-Christian beliefs, Pullman weaves a tale of redemption, not through a higher power but through the power of the self. As a result the Catholic Church boycotted the film, deeming it heretical in its content.
Overall, The Golden Compass is an admirable yet deeply flawed epic. Though it features a strong cast and gorgeous visual effects, these can also be found in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter/dp/B001DPHDIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia/dp/B000E8M0VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>&nbsp;series. What really hurts the film is the inexperience of its writer/director and the lack of faith that the studio placed in him. It's ironic, but ultimately the film about a Golden Compass finds itself lost.

Scorsese does a superb job of creating an unsettling, Gothic mood, with a music score that adds tension and effective, creepy imagery of the island. There's a deliberate slow moving pace to the film, but I think this works well to build tension and lead up to the dramatic conclusion. Some may guess the ending, or at least have clues where it is heading before it reaches the film's final minutes, but, nonetheless Shutter Island is a great film, a successful, stellar adaptation of the novel. The cast particularly shines, especially Leonardo DiCaprio, who turns in an excellent performance, giving depth to his role as Teddy Daniels. Ben Kingsley also does a superb job as the institution's Dr. Cawley.

Teddy Daniels arrives to Shutter Island with his partner to unravel the mysterious disappearance of one of its patients, Rachel Solando. As Teddy and Chuck explore the institution, and find out about Rachel and its inmates. However, Teddy learns more about the mystery and the institution, flashbacks and visions begin to surface that further complicate the plot.
Shutter Island begins with one mystery only to add on another mystery that needs to be accounted for. There are several layers of twists, but these are revealed in fragmented pieces that we put together.

As far as editions to the film, I'd stick with the blu-ray over this edition, as the blu-ray has two featurettes about the film: Behind the Shutters and Into the Lighthouse. The quality is a bit sharper as well.

Over all, Shutter Island is quite an effective, atmospheric experience and, as one reviewer noted, a film that you can view multiple time to pick up clues and meanings. Creepy and weird, but in a good way. Definitely one of Scorsese's best.

It seems as if television has abandoned family programming these days. Even shows that I enjoy feel more geared towards adults than to kids. Perhaps networks feel there is no hope in gathering young viewers when they have to compete with iPads and PlayStation. It seems they also feel that they must pander to the most basic of instincts, sex, to get viewers rather than realize that a good storytelling will draw in everyone. What surprises me more is their insistence to ignore the fact that family movies do so well at the box office. The recent release of WAR ROOM, a Christian based film, stunned Hollywood when it did so well at the box office. The same holds true for Disney films that continue to dominate the box office when released. So why cant they do the same on TV? Who knows?

Until they come to their senses those seeking something their entire family can watch can turn to the world of DVD that brings back the shows of the past that the whole group can watch. And one of the most successful of those shows was LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE. Led by Michael Landon both in front of and behind the camera, the series presented the Ingalls family and their struggle to survive as settlers in the Midwest. Based on the popular series of childrens book it was a hit that stunned the same execs that are mystified today. Maybe they won't learn.

Lionsgate has been offering the various seasons of the hit show in individual sets or in one huge box set for the whole series. If your budget is like mine the single seasons make sense. So what does season 4 offer? Well the same things we saw in the first three seasons basically but with each season having its own specific share of stories.

Many of the stories from this season seemed to take place on the road. Either Charles (Landon) was trying to find work elsewhere or taking someone to a different town or on a trip to a city like Chicago. This resulted in a story involving a hired hand on the farm that sent tongues wagging. The series also began to show that Mary Ingalls (Melissa Sue Anderson) was growing up, having her take on a teaching position at a school that presented a confrontation.

Of course Laura (Melissa Gilbert) remained the focal point of the series with several adventures of her own. One involved finding a baby to take care of and another had her working alongside a friend to solve a mystery. An interest in boys for Laura wasn't quite yet a mix in the plots but the seeds were being sown.

The season also featured friend of the Ingalls John Garvey (ex-football star Merlin Olsen) in several shows as well. This was his first year on the series and he stayed on until season 7. Garveys son on the show became a close friend of Laura and the possibility of young romance could have happened. Watch subsequent seasons to see if it worked out.

Perhaps the most important thing to happen in this season involved Mary. Working as a teacher was her goal in life. That seemed to become a problem in the last two episodes when Mary began having problems with her vision. Would she be able to carry on with her dream if she became blind? Fans already know the answer to this question and what happened. If you aren't aware then its time you started watching this series.

What made this series work was that it wasn't something that you had to worry if your kids could watch it or not. At the same time it was one that kids enjoyed as well. That combination of something for both adults AND kids made it a staple for years. As I said earlier, it seems thats not the case these days. With less than savory hijinks on shows like GOTHAM (which appears during what was once known as the family hour) and with political correctness being included in THE MUPPETS new series, shows that families can feel comfort with are rare. Perhaps it does make sense to return to the ones you trusted in the past. This release makes that possible.",FAMILY FARE THAT STILL HOLDS UP,1445904000,,

Naturally, this is a very off beat anime done by the Gainax crew who basically did FLCL, His and Her Circumstances, and Evanglion.  So it might not be for everyone, and probably isn't for anyone because this has been a sadly under publicised series.
Basic story : Osaka shopping district kid duo gets swept into alternate usiverses of their block where they deal with condensed, stereotypical worlds based on their shopping district home.
It is a 13 episode series released in 2002 in Japan as a kids show.  While it is off beat, it is very enjoyable.  The show uses every bit of information and energy they can muster to keep these silly, fantastic and post modern affairs tangible or at least enjoyable.  Littered through out are tons of sci-fi, anime, manga, hollywood, video game and literature references.  As the father of Harumi says at one point 'No matter how much GEEK knowledge you have, you are no match for me.'
Great animation, wonderful backgrounds and a very offbeat idea.  While these first stories are indeed Gainax, later episodes on fuirther disks are done heavily in Korea and look cheap.  ADV keeps good picture quality, but not always as nice as the original Japanese releases.  Fun fun fun.  Nice acting and posing.  I can't imagine anyone except prudes regretting this purchase.

His name does not appear in the writing credits though.  The writing is credited to James Redford, son of Robert Redford, the Executive Producer.
The story is basically a crime mystery and  includes a lot of Native American folklore.  It's set in the present, on a reservation.  Some medicine men have been brutally murdered, and two cops are looking for the killer.  Adam Beach is cast as the cop who is studying to be a medicine man himself; Wes Studi is also a Native American but he considers himself much more practical and modern in his approach.
The plot is confusing as it twists and turns and I found it almost impossible to follow.  There's a paint factory that polluted the land and people getting sick.  There are medicine men who chose modern medicine over traditional ways.  There's the wife of one of the cops who has come back to the reservation to die.  And there's a romance between Adam Beach and an attractive young female Native American lawyer who learns to appreciate traditional ways.

""New York Minute"" is for those who have grown up alongside Mary-Kate and Ashley and will enjoy seeing them in a movie that, yes, illustrates how much they have grown over the years. Anyone else will laugh, sneer, and tear it to shreds, but fans will respect it for what it is: a fun, lighthearted comedy. Personally, I went to see it the day it was released, and I loved it. I think a lot of people just looked at how highly publicized this film was and expected it to be something off the charts--the Olsen twins' explosion into theatrical production and adulthood. I'll admit that when I saw how much it was being promoted and how much time and work the Olsens were putting into it, I thought it was going to be a very successful film with a high public response. While it wasn't anything like that, it certainly showed a nice amount of improvements from the girls; it was a good plot, impressive acting, and highly entertaining. Compare this with some of their home videos like ""Getting There"" and ""When In Rome,"" and you just might appreciate this movie a little more. I think Mary-Kate and Ashley did a great job; they showed their potential for comedy and proved that once they take the spotlight off them a little bit and focus more on the other aspects of the story, their film is greatly strengthened.
It's a real shame that ""New York Minutes"" fared so poorly at the box office; I imagine it was a real blow for the girls, but they'll get through it. They'll move on. Their 1995 feature film ""It Takes Two"" didn't do so hot either (only pulled in about $20 million), but the VHS and DVD releases sold very well; I have a feeling that the same thing will happen once this film comes to DVD in August. It is exactly the kind of film in which only the real fan can witness the evolution and the maturity in these girls. Yes, they have grown up a lot and have great things ahead of them, but for someone who despises them you're best off staying away from this movie...we all know what you think. Let the loyal followers of Mary-Kate and Ashley watch the movie and give their opinion; they're the best ones to comment because they'll give the twins the fairest shake for their efforts and everything they put into this movie.
Again, I liked it a lot...I thought it was funny and enjoyable, with a far better plot and acting job from the Olsens than I have ever seen before from them.

Premium is confused about whether its supposed to be a decent drama, a dumb comedy, or sheer boring idiocy coupled with enough fast but boringly numerous utterly predictable bike rides and cutesy gimmicking by way of overly graphic simulations of someone using situational awareness to find the clear path of travel and so many multiple flash forward/backs it's supposed to be a challenge to keep track but merely becomes eyerollingly overdone and silly. Characters are so 1D they practically do not exist.  The bad guy is ludicrously silly most of the time, and the good guy is frankly a loser who learns nothing.  There is one bike trick sequence, predictably entirely by the main character.

The movie plays as if someone saw QS years ago and the main parts of it, removed anything in the way of character development or plot development, stuck everything else in a bag, shook it up and removed it randomly, then wrote a screenplay incorporating the elements in a different order of first appearance than the one used in QS and finally added many more bike speed scenes and a couple of gimmicks to try to keep people's interest in the too-thin-for-this-length-movie story.

It is a series of riveting, interlocking vignettes that tell the story on all fronts of the war on drugs. It paints a picture that will stay with the viewer for some time, so powerful is the imagery employed and so compelling are the actors in their performances.
Michael Douglas plays the part of Robert Wakefield, a newly appointed drug czar, who tries to mount an all points attack on the drug trade. Naive and well meaning, he is, unbeknownst to him, being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico, who are fighting a turf war over the profitable drug trade. He is so clueless that when the drug war actually lands on his door step, as when his teenage daughter, wonderfully portayed by Erika Christiansen, succumbs to peer pressure and becomes addicted to drugs, he is initially in heavy denial and ignores all the standard warning circles, until it is nearly too late
Benicio Del Toro, in the star making role of Javier, an intelligent, decent, and honest Mexican law enforcement officer, who has his own war on drugs going on, is riveting with his quietly powerful performance . He, too, is being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico. Nearly too late he realizes that the Mexican gweneral, who is ostensibly battling the war on drugs and to whom Javier had given his full support and cooperation, is engaged in some drug action on the side from which he hopes to profit. The only drug war that the general is really involved in is the one that one drug cartel has with its rival.
Meanwhile, back in the states, a wealthy and respected San Diego business man, played by hunky Steven Bauer, is arrested, as it seems that his businesses are really just a front for the drug trade. His assets frozen, this leaves his beautiful and greedy wife, played by the lovely and talented Catherine Zeta-Jones, picking up the pieces of her husband's empire while he is in jail, awaiting trial. As regent to the kingdom, she cold boodedly negotiates with the drug cartel to restore her and her husband financially. No shrinking violet is she!
There are several other subplots that are also of note and move the story along. All of these vignettes interlock with one another in some fashion, serving to bring the story full circle.

It did decent business at the box office but nothing to brag about. With the passing of Tupac Shakur interest increased and fans clamored for any and all things Tupac. Now the film makes its way to blu-ray courtesy of Olive Video.

Det. Frank Divinci and Det. Rodriguez (James Belushi and Tupac) are two corrupt cops more interested in making money than in doing their jobs. This isn't to say they cant get the job done that they're paid to do, they are good at finding bad guys. But becoming bad guys they find themselves in more trouble than expected.

The two have stolen drugs, sold them, took the money from their mark and then killed him. Who would notice a dead drug dealer, especially if the detectives investigating the killing were these two cops? Problems arise when their latest mark turns out to be an undercover DEA agent.

Given the job of finding the killer the pair come upon a homeless man (Dennis Quaid) and pin the rap on him. They even get Franks girlfriend (Lela Rochon) to testify that she saw him do it. But their plan starts to unravel on several levels. Rochon begins to have second doubts about what she is doing. Worse yet it turns out that Quaid is actually a wealthy businessman who went missing some years ago. His lawyers turn up to rescue him and with that everything begins to fall apart. As the duo tries to figure out what to do clues to the real killer begin to mount.

What makes the movie interesting is that it is told from their perspective, two corrupt cops as opposed to a mainstream hero trying to solve the mystery. Instead we have the reverse with two killers who have the means to cover their trail easily but who create so many mistakes that their tension over what to do next becomes ours as well.

Its difficult to sympathize with these two main characters but before the movie ends you find yourself wondering if perhaps they will do the right thing. Therein lies much of the tension found in the film. That desire to make atonement for past indiscretions while at the same time knowing it will results in the loss of your freedom and perhaps the loss of your life makes you wonder if either is willing to go through with it. At the same time you wonder if they will indeed get away with it all.

Tupac showed that he had a career ahead of him as an actor with a meaty role like this. He does a fantastic job and is quite believable in the part. Its a shame he never had the opportunity. Ive said for years that Belushi was a better actor than people have given him credit for. He started off in the shadow of his older brother John and then was pushed into comedic roles only for a time. His handling of dramatic roles showed he could do both.

While its nice that Olive has released the film on blu-ray for fans of the film and of Tupac they once again show no effort to present anything but the movie itself. Extras are non-existent. As they move forward lets hope more of their releases see some effort on their part for things that some would enjoy. In the meantime at least the film is offered in a well done format with a nice print to work from. If you enjoy gritty cop dramas then you're bound to enjoy this one.",BEST LAID PLANS,1502323200,,

Tara Lee is a London-based yoga instructor who has created the Elements of Yoga DVD series. As she explains in her short introduction to ""Fire Dynamic"" (or Fire Vinyasa, as it's titled on the Main Menu), the purpose here is create heat in the body and to release toxins by incorporating twisting postures.

For all practices on this DVD, Lee teaches via voiceover. Fire is set outdoors at night, with several large flaming tubs placed around the set, casting smoke throughout the video. Lee's main prop is a mat (with the orientation frequently changing from parallel to the viewer to perpendicular due to shifting camera views), although occasionally an inset is shown with modification options, and she also uses a blanket for shoulderstand. Lee sometimes notes the names of the postures in English, sometimes in Sanskrit, sometimes not at all.

The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options: Introduction--Play Workout--Practice 1 (20 mins)--Practice 2 (20 mins)--Practice 3 (35 mins)--Shavasana (5 mins)--Bonus Features--Music Options. Music Options includes choices for ""Music & Instruction"" and ""Music Only,"" but no option for ""Instruction Only"" (a.k.a. a ""Music Off"" option). The individual practices work as stand-alone sequences, but they can also be combined together for a full routine. I have provided detailed information on each practice below.

PRACTICE 1 (actual time=23 minutes)
This practice focus on breath and core work. Lee starts seated for about seven minutes of breathwork, including ujjayi breathing, Kapalabhati (skull shining breath), and breath retention with bandhas. Core work begins with boat pose variations, including moving one arm and one leg. Coming to all fours, Lee performs cat/cow with lion's breath and then bird-dog, adding an elbow-to-knee touch; she finishes this sequence with kneeling dancer's pose and hip circles. Lee then moves between forearm plank and forearm down dog. She does a twist in an all fours position and then plank with fast knee-ins. After resting in child's pose, she performs several vinyasas: down dog to plank, down dog to knees hovering above the floor, down dog to toe lifts, and then down dog to bent knees. Lee comes to standing and concludes with a twisting standing forward bend and chair pose.

PRACTICE 2 (actual time=20 minutes)
Lee suggests setting an intention (sankalpa) at the start of this practice. She moves through a forward bending sequence with breath retention, then comes through a vinyasa back into down dog and side plank. After a single sun salutation, she moves through another vinyasa to 3-legged dog. She brings in the knee to chest three times and then ends in pigeon pose, adding a twist to either side. Returning to 3-legged down dog, she brings the knee in to the opposite side three times before coming into a straight leg stretch and then repeating the entire series on the other side. Returning to standing, Lee concludes this routine with big toe and gorilla forward bends.

PRACTICE 3 (actual time=34 minutes)
This was the only practice that truly centered around twists as Lee mentioned in her introduction, but the fact that it was so much longer than the other two routines on the DVD felt unbalanced to me. The initial focus is on standing postures, and Lee moves right from a vinyasa into a standing pose flow including warrior 1, warrior 3, half moon, and triangle (repeated on other side). The second series starts with revolved low lunge (optional bind) and continues with pyramid pose, revolved triangle, revolved half moon, and 3-legged plank pose; after repeating on the other side, the sequence concludes with wide-legged standing forward bend. Next, Lee moves into tree pose, adding in a side stretch. This is followed by toe balance and an arm balance, flying crow pose. Moving through a vinyasa to squatting, Lee performs another arm balance, crow, and then several seated postures, including cobbler's pose, wide-legged seated forward bend, half Lord of the fishes pose with a twist to the opposite side, and double pigeon. She then transitions to her stomach for several backbends, including locust, bow, and camel, then (returning to her back) bridge and wheel pose. She windshield wipers the knees and then performs a twist with the foot resting on the knee. Lee cues shoulderstand (she uses a blanket here) for about 1 minute, coming out of this posture into plow, deaf-man's pose, and fish. A short (1.5 minutes) savasana concludes this routine.

Selecting Bonus Features off the Main Menu brings up a submenu which offers the same options on all three Elements of Yoga DVDs. In addition to three short yoga practices, the bonus submenu includes a Q & A with Lee (11 mins) and Credits. The routines are as follows:

Earth--Balances (9 mins)
Air and Water--Breathing (10 mins)
Fire--Core (Advanced) (11 mins)

Unlike the other DVDs in her Elements of Yoga series, ""Fire Dynamic"" is clearly intended for experienced yoga practitioners only. Although Lee provides decent instruction overall (but not mirrored cuing), she does not offer enough information for those newer to yoga. This DVD would be best suited to those looking for a more intense yoga experience while still incorporating breath and stress relief.",Most intense DVD offered in the Elements of Yoga series,1374624000,13,

Since my goal is to become an instructor, I do want to look at different teaching styles. I guess I decided to try it when I read that Ansuya was involved and the DVD had a bonus solo performance. I figured anything with Ansuya couldn't be a total loss. She is an incredible dancer and one of the most sought-after performers and instructors in the country.

The first surprise was that I immediately recognized Stevie from the Bellydance Superstars. Upon reading the credits, I found that the more voluptuous dancer I was proud of Kathy for including is Louchia, who I've heard of but haven't seen perform.

Next, it really is a good workout that actively employs bellydance. The slow workout helps beginners learn the moves and is good practice for the intermediate.  The fast workout is fun and great for burning fat. You'll really work your muscles, especially your abs, in both workouts. I have been dancing for about seven months and found it challenging enough to keep me interested, and I was a little sore the next day, especially in the obliques. The fact that the workout is structured so that the moves flow like an actual dance is this DVD's main strength.

Now for the criticisms - thank Goddess that Ansuya was there. Kathy's verbal instruction isn't the best. There's  a brief tutorial with Ansuya at the end of the workout that offers a lot of great instruction in about five minutes - a lot more than Kathy offers in half an hour. Kathy rushes Ansuya through it and rudely interrupts her several times, prompting me to think, ""What's the rush?"" The photography is better than most videos in that you have a good visual of the movement, helpful because the verbal cues are lacking. Ansuya's tutorial is listed on the menu after the workout when it should have been first, so watch it before you start, especially if you are a beginner. There's not quite enough time spent on breaking down the basic moves during the workout.

And speaking of cues - Kathy should have worked on changing her cuing style for this one. She sounds more like she's teaching aerobics than bellydance in both workouts, which didn't take long to get on my nerves. I want my bellydance practice to be more sensual and relaxing. Bellydance has become almost as spiritual as yoga for me. This type of cuing kind of ruins that. ""Give it to me now!"" and those wierd aerobics instructor grunting and howling noises just don't work in a bellydance workout. Kathy should have asked Ansuya to teach her how to zaghareet! In fact, she contradicts one of the most beautiful things about bellydance - it makes positive changes in your body without feeling like a workout.

And I honestly do not mean to sound mean here......at the beginning of the workout Kathy says that she loves bellydance because it makes her feel sexy, but Kathy is absolutely the least sensuous woman I have ever seen bellydance. It's pitiful. She calls the slow workout a ""sensuous"" workout, but you'll have to add your own sensuality. Although it's obvious that Kathy really worked with Ansuya to learn bellydance, that graceful, feminine quality we admire and feel in our art is just not there. You can take the girl out of the gym but you can't take the gym out of the girl..... Kathy's hair and makeup are nicely done and they put her in a pretty costume, but she still looks like an athlete trying to bellydance. It seems that she can't get out of workout mode. Although she's doing the moves correctly, Kathy is working out, not dancing. Again, thank Goddess there are four sensuous dancers to counteract that but we don't see enough of them. In the second workout, Kathy is too far up front and they are way in the back.  There are a few closeups of them but Stevie, an excellent dancer, doesn't get much camera time at all. She's so far off to the side that I wasn't sure at first if that was her or a mirror image of Kathy. Ansuya and possibly another one of the dancers should have been right up front with Kathy instead of in the back like students. Kathy would have been smarter to do that since it would have taken some of the focus off her. Watch these dancers, not Kathy, to get a better idea of how it's done.

There are actually two solo performances by Ansuya. The first is part of the workout, where she demonstrates the moves that have just been taught in a short choreography, and the second is a brief - too brief - performance in costume in the bonus features. The ""Behind the Scenes Bonus"" feature is simply a one or two minute clip of Kathy and the dancers making the video, nothing special. The cooldown session is a great stretch and very relaxing, and it would be a good idea to do it first as a warmup, especially if you are only going to do the fast workout.

It's taken me two years to recover from my second back surgery and seven months of dancing to finally be ready to work toward getting back to the excellent shape I used to be in. I'll use this one when I feel energetic and want more cardio for fat burning.

Whether you like Kathy Smith or not, she's respected in the field and has a following. I think she's one of the better video instructors out there - far superior to Denise Austin - but she should have adapted her style to fit the workout.  I am glad that she made an effort to bring bellydance to more women but I wish she'd done a better job. A brief history of the dance to help educate the public would have helped. I do give her a lot of credit for taking the time to actually learn bellydance from an expert.

I've worked out with videos for about 20 years now and have come to realize that they must be quite difficult to make. Even the best have their faults, mainly with cuing and photography. I've come to the conclusion that none are perfect and the actual workout is what counts. Criticisms of the instructor aside, this is still a very good workout and you will actually be learning real bellydance moves instead of doing aerobics that mimic bellydancing. I gave it four stars because as a workout, it's envigorating and safe and would be effective when practiced regularly. It's suitable for all levels. Each workout is only about 20 minutes long and that's great for those who are short on time. The choreography is fun and easy to pick up, especially if you have some bellydance experience.

This DVD can help keep your body looking it's best in your costume. And hey, you can always buy it to watch Ansuya!

However, as the film unfolded I found myself drawn in, like a puppy to a bowl of 'forbidden' food. The movie follows several different characters as they search for true love. One couple is married (Jennifer Connelly and Bradley Cooper). One couple doesn't necessarily believe in marriage (Ben Afleck and Jennifer Anniston). Two girls just want to be a couple (Gennifer Goodwin and Drew Barrymore). Two guys also want to be couples, though they don't know it yet (Kevin Connolly and Justin Long). And then there's one girl (Scarlett Johansson) that's just disgusting in her actions. And that's not all of the stars that are in the movie, but you get the point.

Anyway, the film is basically a mosaic at first, presenting the viewer with a quote that happens to set the scene for what's coming up. This mosaic introduces you to the many, many different characters that are all indirectly inter-related. People start to date or fall apart or whatever. And then the second half of the movie throws the ""quote"" thing out the window and follows the choices the people have made.

My problem with this movie was that there were too many characters, or too many connections. I can handle that when it's presented over a long bout of time (like in Lost), but when it's crammed into a 2-hour spot it's too much. It's like A and B are together, but B falls for C, who happens to be with D, who is best friends with E. F and G are in a relationship, and G is B's best friend. H is looking for a relationship and gets help and advice from her co-workers, A and F. And that's not even half of it. I'm sure the creators used some sort of flow chart or matrix to work everything out. Overall, the plot was semi-interesting, but I only really cared about a few of the characters. Nothing fantastic with this one.","Uh, Why Did I Watch This Again?",1288828800,,

5.0,False,"08 1, 2010",AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B000EAT24G,{'Format:': ' DVD'},KG,"I don't love every film in this collection.  Almodovar is too brave and experimental for every one of his films to appeal equally to all but the most devoted fans.  If you like his early, wild, anything-to-break-convention work, you may find his later work too mild or conventional.  If, like me, you find those later films deeply moving and appreciate their more mature tone, you may not be as thrilled by the early work, finding it full of guts, but lacking a bit of heart.

But having these films altogether is a wonderful look into the extremely diverse work of one of the bravest and most interesting film makers of our generation.  Even the films I don't deeply love personally are full of unforgettable images, moments, pieces of acting or writing.  In a world of film that often aims for the middle, Almodovar shoots for the stars, and that's worth seeing whether you personally think an individual film gets there or not.

The prices fluctuate wildly, but this set can be a good deal.  To get these 8 films seperately is going to cost you at least $80 or $90 with shipping, and some - like 'Live Flesh' - are currently out of print and overpriced themselves anyway.

Also, a couple of these discs - 'All About My Mother' and 'Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown' are in upgraded form -- although there is some argument whether the upgrades are for the better.  DVD Beaver, which I find the most in depth DVD review site concludes the versions in the set ARE superior, and provide side by side images for comparison.

While everyone will (and should) have very individual reactions to these complex, challenging (if often fun) films, here's my order of preference and my personal notes on the films;

All About My Mother (1999) - My favorite Almodovar film to date. He finally combines the best of his older, absurdist films, with his new found maturity and real emotion that began to emerge in 'Flower of My Secret' and 'Live Flesh'.  A woman's son dies, while trying to get an autograph from a great actress, leaving his mother bereft, and trying to start a new life. I won't give away any details, but her journey is both funny and tragic, and leads to some terrifically unexpected and sometimes ironic places. Full of odd and wonderful characters, and some very strong acting. A bit cute or 'forced' in a few moments, but overall a moving, special and wonderful film. If you don't know Almodovar's work, this is an excellent place to start.

Talk to Her (2002) My second favorite Almodovar film.  A moving and complex study of the relationship between two men, and their connection to women in comas. A few brilliantly funny moments, and some ultimately very creepy undertones keep it from being over-sentimental. Every character is more complex then they first appear, and the confusion between what is good and what is bad in both intent and effect is very rich. Some great camera work too. Gets slow in a few spots, and the sentiment still goes over the top in a few places, but still a terrific film about the similarities and differences between love and obsession.

Live Flesh (1997) A maturing Almodovar in a less absurd - if still melodramatic - mode than his early films. This time the tone is more film noir/mystery/character study. Unlike most of the early work, this is generally `serious', with just touches of his humor. Visually very striking and dark. Wonderful performances, including an early one by Javier Bardem.  I appreciate how all the characters are grey, no one is `good' or bad'. Basically it's a love triangle with multiple angles, and a cop drama about violence and love. What it's missing (for me at least) , and keeps it a very good film, not a great one, is deeper levels of emotion. It's always interesting, but I didn't ultimately find it affecting. Also a couple of key plot contrivances are clunky - which the anarchic young Almodovar could get away with, since everything was absurd anyway. But when you're being more `real', forced twists feel more... well, forced. Still a highly enjoyable film well worth seeing, and another important step in the growth of a major filmmaker.

Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1985) Great fun, as Almodovar's visual sophistication continues to expand from film to film, and his ability to create a subtle mix of the campy, the surreal, and real emotion grows ever stronger. Full of odd and silly twists and turns, and populated by absurd but still very human characters. It's also a film with a theme - the amazing strength and resilience of women.  So why not a 5 star rating for a film a lot of smart people consider a flat-out masterpiece?. Maybe I need to re-see it a third time, but on recent round of working my way through all of Almodovar's films, it felt paper thin. I enjoyed it, but it didn't feel like a film that would stick with me, or effect me. In some ways, I found the far more flawed `Matador' has more unforgettable images, moments and challenging power. That said, this is still very worth your time. You'll smile a lot.

Bad Education (2004) Fascinatingly complex nourish mystery. A film-maker is reunited with a boyhood lover, who wants to tell a dark story from their Catholic school days. But is the story true? And who's story is it really? Gael Garcia Bernal is terrific in a complicated, multi faceted role, and all the acting is very good. Gorgeously shot, with a great score.  I wish I felt more emotionally, but my mind was always completely absorbed, even if my heart stayed a little cool. Maybe that's the nature of a film where everyone is hustling and using each other.

(mild spoilers ahead)

A bit obvious and self-conscious in a few spots, and pederastic Catholic priests is a clich the film only partially transcends (although the humanity given to the priest makes it far more interesting), and a couple of the climactic twists feel less motivated than what comes before. But worth it for the `Vertigo' like layers of reality that keep getting pulled back and forcing us to keep reassessing `good', `bad', `art' and `real.' Many critics consider this Almodovar's masterpiece - and I could see watching it a third time. This is the kind of film that grows on repeated viewings.

Matador (1987) Almodovar meets DePalma in this dark thriller with less `jokes' than most of his films, though black humor pervades the whole thing. All the characters are obsessed with death; a murderess who kills during sex, a teacher of matadors who lives to kill, and masturbates to snuff films, and a student who wishes he could kill but faints at the sight of blood. Some of the twists are silly, obvious and/or cop-outs, and the characters never feel `real', but there are some great, operatic disturbing and funny moments as well. Sort of a thinking person's, surrealist `Fatal Attraction'. Some of it is clunky, but the film sticks with me. Very good performances all around. Most critics I respect liked it even more than me, and I'll probably re-visit it down the line.  As with many Almodovar films,  it seems like the kind of film that could easily grow on a second viewing -- its flaws more forgivable, its strengths more powerful.

Flower of My Secret (1996) Sweet, and very well acted. This is much less wild and outrageous than earlier Almodovar, but compensates by having more real emotion. Still, this has two of his usual key elements -- dramatic use of intense color, and a melodramatic, almost soapy, story. It's clear he loves melodrama at the same time he gently pokes fun at it.  But in 'Flower of My Secret' the soap has more underpinnings in humanity, with subtler behavior and humor. Technically he gets even better with this film. It's beautiful, shot in a more subdued style than his earlier work. Not a great movie, but a good, entertaining, human one that paves the way to his later fully 'real' and moving masterpieces like 'Talk to Her'. Lovely performances.  There seem to be two distinct groups among Almodovar fans. Those who prefer his earlier, wilder, more genre busting work, and those who prefer his more recent, subtler films. I'm in the second group, but can completely understand those who feel differently. And where you fall on that scale is likely to have a big impact on your reaction to this film.

Law of Desire (1987) Clearly a technical step forward with some stunning visuals, and solid performances.  But the melodramatic love/murder plot of a director obsessed with one man, while another is obsessed with him just got a little creaky and tiresome for me after a while.  It's not absurd  or campy enough to be funny, or real enough to raise strong emotions.",A great collection,1280620800,,

The macguffin of the plot is a ball that is supposedly able to store steam at enormous pressure and density. It doesn't make much sense, but it manages to drive a plot with a lot of action, engaging steam-puffing war machines, and some moderately sophisticated debate about the uses of science and technology.

The characters are engaging, although hero Ray is  the usual somewhat generic plucky adolescent. The spoiled adolescent aristocrat Scarlett is considerably more interesting, as are Ray's father and grandfather, who personify conflicting ideas about the uses of technology.

The animation is, of course, wonderful, as expected from the director of Akira. The film is full of strikingly original action scenes, which are both well conceived and well executed. Destruction abounds. Reputedly, the film used quite a bit of computer graphics, but it is extraordinarily well integrated. The hand-drawn characters do not have the ""pasted in"" look that has characterized most previous attempts to combine hand drawn and computer generated art, and I was hard put to tell where the traditional animation ended and the computer animation began.

The DVD includes both the original Japanese version (with English subtitles available) as well as an English dubbed version. The English dubbing is extremely well done, with top notch talent including Anna Paquin (Rogue from the XMen movies) as the adolescent boy hero, Patrick Stewart as his grandfather, and Alfred Molina as his father. The English dubbing was overseen by Otomo himself, and is arguably better suited to the story than the original Japanese, as it is set in Victorian England. There are, however, a few moments where the words do not quite mesh with the mouth movements--which is a bit of a testament to the quality of the animation; in most animated films, you can't tell what language the characters are supposed to be speaking, anyway.

Although this is an animated film, it is not a kid's movie, and some parents will probably find some scenes inappropriate for small children. There is a lot of violence and destruction, at least as much as in a typical theatrical action thriller, but relatively little gore or overt killing--less than in Akira. There is, however, a moment when young Scarlett comes face-to-face with a dead soldier. It is an important and necessary scene, but might be troubling to some children.",Worthy successor to Akira,1122595200,,

Unlike the Apostles Collection DVD set released by the History Channel which contained too much reenactments and dramatizations of the events to explain things, this series goes further deep to take you beyond the icons to reveal the flesh-and-blood pillars of the early church. The series has ten episodes, namely:

3. John
4. James
5. Matthew
6. Thomas
7. Bartholomew and Philip
8. James, Thaddeus (Jude) and Simon
9. Judas

Each episode focuses on the featured Apostle and looks more closely at his life by examining the many facts and details through fascinating historical and biblical evidence. The series unveils many of the sites made sacred by the visitation of Apostles in their mission to spread the gospel to every part of the world. It was absolutely soul stirring to learn about the manner of martyrdom of each Apostle and to witness the Holy relics (even skulls) of some of the Apostles kept in various churches erected in their remembrance, which today attract millions of pilgrims all over the world. To be able to view the cave on the island of Patmos where Apostle John received the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ was so blessed and blissful. It was also quite remarkable to learn of the impact and the legacy, the Apostles have left on the cities/countries they visited. The remarks of renowned biblical scholars, experts, and members of the clergy were very helpful in understanding the story of early Christianity. The narration throughout the series was excellent. This series has definitively made me aware of many important facts about the Apostles which I never knew or could have otherwise known.

Mary Pickford: A Life on Film is a fine documentary that gives people a thorough and poignant introduction to the life and times of Mary Pickford. The documentary tells the viewer about Mary's parents and grandparents; and we learn that sadly she had little time for childhood after her father died when she was quite young. Indeed, Mary was the family breadwinner from a very early age, on the road with an acting troupe and displaying a tenacity that few adults ever could! The still photos of Mary, her mother and siblings are terrific! Mary's story flows along nicely during the film; it never slows down to a point where it becomes boring or tedious. Whoopi Goldberg also does a great job of narrating the film; and the interviews with Mary's surviving contemporaries are both informative and very well done. I also appreciated the archival footage of Mary's films; although all the clips were very short we get so many of them that this viewer understood Mary's remarkable artistic prowess.

The viewer learns a lot; I'm keeping this comparatively brief to avoid giving away too much of Mary's life story. Born Gladys Marie Smith in Toronto in 1892, she used her real name and even as a child travelled the road with an acting troupe to make money for her family at home. At the urging of producer David Belasco, Gladys changed her name to Mary Pickford and eventually worked for D.W. Griffith and others in numerous movies. At first Mary wasn't credited in films because actors never got credit at that time; but that did not last long. In the early days of silent film there were few rules and therefore a woman could potentially climb the ladder in the film industry--and that's what Mary did. Not only was Mary a consummate actress, she was a shrewd businesswoman who wanted money from her profitable films--and then control over them. She was one of the founders of United Artists, too! Just as they say, Mary was the first American actress to achieve international stardom. We see proof of that: there's footage showing the overjoyed but chaotic mobs of people who showed up to great Mary and then husband Douglas Fairbanks were when they were on a tour of Europe. They were treated like royalty even in Moscow!

There are other parts of Mary's story that are not so happy; the filmmakers gloss over the not-so-good times. Her first two marriages to Owen Moore and Douglas Fairbanks ended in divorce. They definitely gloss over Mary's issues with alcohol; her unsuccessful films and her not so motherly nature after she and her third husband Charles ""Buddy"" Rogers adopted two children. Perhaps this is due to the fact that Charles ""Buddy"" Moore was one of the producers of this film; he probably wanted his late wife Mary to appear in the best possible light.

Some may wonder if Mary was an American actress because she was born in Canada; but because she was born on the same continent as the USA it's legitimate to call her ""American"" and ""America's Sweetheart"" during her years of great fame.

Newcomers to Mary Pickford and the more casual fan like me will learn much from this film. People who are already diehard Pickford fans will learn less about Mary and should probably keep looking for more comprehensive films or candid books about Mary Pickford from reliable sources.","+ 1/2 star: ""Make them laugh, make them cry, and back to laughter""",1348358400,,

In it, a character named Paulo Roberto, who is an ex-boxer, fights with a blond giant who can't feel pain. He almost wins. He certainly saves another minor character from a gruesome death. It's one of the true highlights of the book.

And one of the highlights of watching this movie is seeing the name ""Paulo Roberto"" in the credits, and realizing that he is a real person who plays himself, in a fictional role. Much like Dan Marino in Ace Ventura, but with substantially better acting. And his fight with the stoic Ronald Niedermann is probably the best action scene in a movie that could use a few more of them.

This movie takes a turn away from the self-contained serial killer story of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, and follows the adventures of societal mis-fit Elizabeth Salander, who is apparently connected on several levels to the darkest secrets of the Swedish government. Unfortunately, all three stories in the ""Millenium Trilogy"" have a bad habit of pretending to be about Salander, when they're really more focused on journalist Mikael Blomkvist, and whatever vast conspiracy he's threatening to unearth this week. Don't get me wrong, Blomkvist makes for a great protagonist (and is expertly acted by Michael Nyqvist), but Salander often gets relegated to the sidelines (she spends most of the movie hiding out as a murder suspect).

The movie tends to be more straightforward than the book. If you're a purist, you probably won't like that. Subplots are excised, and so are main plots. The central murders of the story are because of an illegal sex trade, but this is barely mentioned again, once we find out Salander's prints are on the gun.

The movie ends with a quasi-cliffhanger, as Salander tracks down her long-lost father, who is more or less not happy to be found. If you want all your loose ends neat and tidy, you'll have to watch part three (THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST).",Paulo Roberto as His Fictional Self,1312934400,,

Worst come to worst I can store the DVDs in my CD case which solves the problem on the so called awful DVD packaging.,Don't Listen To All The Negative Nancys Reviews,1408320000,6,

I loved it start to finish, very admiring of the script, cinematography, direction, casting, acting and the loving care given to every detail.  And I loved the ending, the kind of ending that means you'll have to watch the film again, and again many times possibly.  But upon reflection I also think there are enough holes in the premise to drive several large Army trucks through.  Then again maybe it's not holes but failure to provide an explanation.  Because from what I'm told, the other world is indeed constructed mentally but is as physical as this one, and that what people love here is replicated over there, including homes and fondest possessions. So that means the film would add up.  Though respecting Nicole Kidman's art I have never fallen in love with her an actress, always feeling she was cold and remote.  But in this film I fell hook, line and sinker for her classic beauty, subtlety, being her character and not just acting her character, and the immense range and shading of what she does in this film.  But, then, the entire acting ensemble is outstanding.  I'm sure I will watch this one again and again and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves memorable films.",Fascinating,1317254400,,

This movie is HALF-RIGHT because of the reasons listed below.

THE GOOD

- The plot is ORIGINAL. I've never seen a movie where a girl of 12 years old was a vampire. She killed and sucked the blood out of people.

- The movie brings up a social dilemma. That is if a child of 12 years committed a murder, should he/she be tried as an adult or a juvenile? What makes some people angry is juvenile punishment is like a slap on the wrist.

- The acting of the actress who portrays Eli is fascinating. She makes me keep watching and watching.

- There are some very bloody scenes that will keep gore fans happy.

THE BAD

- The pace is slow compared to Hollywood movies.

- The main actor who portrays Oskar does not show emotion on his face.

- There's no suspense. Curiosity is what made me watching this till the end, not suspense.

- There's one scene which is very disturbing. In my opinion, it borders child pornography. That is the scene where Eli visited Oskar in his apartment. Oskar had her changed in to one of his mother's dresses. Then he accidentally saw her private part. Why did the director have to include that scene? It does not have anything to do with the plot at all.

Overall, it's absolutely worth watching.",This movie is HALF-RIGHT because: ORIGINAL PLOT + Good acting of the acctress portraying Eli +  SLow Pace,1236816000,,

And not a big fan of Pittsburgh, either. But, after seeing their two performances in this masterful piece of artwork which showcases the best of this huge Pennsylvania hamlet, I'm a big fan of all three.
Wonder Boys spins the tale of Professor Tripp, new protege James Leer (brilliantly acted by the soon-to-reckoned with Tobey MacGuire), a feisty editor named Crabtree, and a confused Chancellor (by the amazing Frances McDormand), all meshing and re-meshing together over the course of a turbulent, bridge building weekend. Their paths are multiple and complicated; there is no room to rest in this film. You never doubt its story, up to its satisfying and right conclusion. You cannot go wrong with Wonder Boys.

The filmmaker himself tries to push his atheist ideas on believers to question their faith . My question is Why ? What for ? People are free to decide to believe in God or not . I have read countless books on the subject and yes I believe in Jesus and in God . There was a historical Jesus as noted and written  down by ancient historians such  as Josephus  1 st c AD, The Roman historian Tacitus 1st c  AD also  Pliny  who was the Roman governor of Bithynia in Asia Minor. Even in the Jewish Talmud the Jews make reference to Jesus even though they do not believe him to be the messiah they acknowledged a real Jesus at the time existed  .Quote ; On the eve of the Passover Yeshu was hanged. Let me ask a question here .. do you think normal people hundreds of thousands  at the time with random  persecutions going on in the Roman empire would gladly die ""peacefully non violently ""in the arenas or tortured and burned  at the hands of their accusers if they did not really  believe in Jesus ? or maybe ,prehaps  had revelations to them from the holy spirit ,,.Yet they died willingly . Why because they believed in something real and had faith  .Do not confuse modern Christianity with  the real early apostolic  Christianity  . The inquisitions in the middle ages and crusades were not bible related or sanctioned by God but by men wrongly interpreting the word of God to their benefit or gain lets be clear on this. And this includes idiots like Pat Robinson, Jimmy Swaggert , and so on  he even makes a reference to charles manson as Jesus  etc . Now yes these references to Dionysus or Adonis or Osiris or Mithra  have similar stories to Christs life death and resurrection ""but these are all deceptions"" of the evil one to lay a foundation to confuse people before the truth and light came to this earth. So folks don't believe the hype of this film and to add to insult the filmmaker purposely deceives the school director as you will see. Also in the school chapel the filmmaker shouts out aloud an insult against the holy spirit to prove a point  , but why insult the holy spirit ? how childish .Jesus would ask why do you hate me so ?  He looks rather insane to by the look of him .To bad the man lost his way .",Not worth the view Amateurish at most,1307836800,,

5.0,True,"10 10, 2010",A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B0029XZODO,{'Format:': ' Blu-ray'},barry,"DEXTER is one of those rare dramas that started with a bang from the get go and has only gotten better with each season.  I purchased this set of the first three seasons and watched all 36 episodes over a matter of two weeks.  It honestly takes only the pilot episode for the show to strongly establish the story line, introduce all the characters as fully developed people and even start a strong plot line.  Of course what holds the show together is Dexter himself.  If this show hadn't been handled so perfectly it could have easily crossed many lines of taste and morals.  But instead it is written, directed, acted and produced with intense loving care and intelligence.

We have Dexter Morgan who is a blood splatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department.  He was orphaned at an early age and brought intro a cops family where he quickly formed a strong bond with his sister Debra as well as Harry, his adoptive father.  Dexter saw much bad as an infant and his father notices his tendencies that aren't fully human.  Dexter cannot feel emotions and doesn't understand the difference between right and wrong.  He also has a strong desire to kill.  His father Harry teaches him a code to live and  also to kill by when he must.  He teaches him how to fake emotions and how to behave to appear as belonging in normal society.  Michael C. Hall embodies the adult Dexter fully.  He had a strong character on a previous series SIX FEET UNDER but all that is forgotten with his tour de force performance on DEXTER.  The show is seen through the eyes of Dexter.  His voice over tells us all Dexter is experiencing as the plotlines develop.  We have here a serial killer who only kills people who deserve to die - the serial killers and murderers in society.  For the writers and Michael C. Hall to get the audience to root for a serial killer is a great feat.

The first season is amazing and concerns the search for the Ice Truck Killer.  The season runs strong and the finale is amazing - so amazing that season two seemed to start a little slow.  But leave it to DEXTER.  The writers were only continuing the story as necessary to keep everything believable.  And with the blink of an eye season two becomes amazing as well as we now have the Bay Harbor Butcher.  Season three was the first to introduce a guest star throughout the season and we have Jimmy Smits as Miami DA Miguel Prado.  He and Dexter become friends which is a new and confusing thing for Dexter.  Miguel also becomes a sort of apprentice and things get out of control.  In season four John Lithgow appears as The Trinity Killer and DEXTER raises the bar in all areas and it becomes the best season thus far.

All characters are believable and acting superb.  Introduced in the first season is troubled soul Rita, a woman with whom Dexter can find some peace.  Her presence other than Debra is the only calming influence for Dexter.  Many tv series have been put on blu ray and it is only a gimmick to take advantage of the new media.  Often picture and audio is lacking and honestly not much better than the dvd option.  DEXTER is the definite exception.  Taking place in Miami there are many beautiful outside shots of sea, sky and beautiful scenery.  It is all crisp and clear.  Facial tones are impeccable and everything about the blu ray video transfer is first rate.  Seeing the close ups and the crispness and ratio of colors and great definition between black/white colors will have the viewer amazed.  And the audio is also heads above the dvd and tv digital options.  The series opening segment begins each episode with strong bass and vibrant sound.  Dialogue is crisp and over it all Dexter's voice over is strong and prominent. It is as if the viewer is in his mind.  And the music is so much more noticable.  When the killings happen all speakers are put to scary use.  The show is more of a front speaker driven show with home theater systems and it is utilized well.  Also when needed the rear speakers come to life full force.  Audio is definitely superb.

DEXTER only gets better with each season.  With a great cast, superb writing and the amazing presence of Michael C. Hall as Dexter the show is the most innovative, risk taking and simply the best on tv.  When will Michael C. Hall finally get his well deserved Emmy?  And finally, all the seasons on blu ray come highly recommended.  It ups the ante on the show in every way and shows just how great blu ray can be.",Best show on tv - amazing on blu ray,1286668800,,

All too often has been the case during the early adoption phase of any new format, the answer at best, is maybe.  Improved but due to the source materials and/or mastering methods used, perhaps not fully utilizing the capabilities available with the new technology during any expected learning curve.

While my media center isn't what one would consider esoteric, it is for most purposes a capable and representative home theater environment for many featuring a 65"" Panasonic plasma display (custom settings but not fully calibrated), Pioneer Elite A/V receiver outputting to a matched JBL 7.1 speaker system about a year technologically obsolete this date.

Being a long time Porsche automotive enthusiast, a fan of both Steve McQueen and the 24 Hours of Le Mans motor race, I have certainly enjoyed multiple viewings of this film through the years and quite familiar with it both visually and sonically from beginning to end.  There are multiple reviews available on different websites so with rare exception, the comments I express here will be limited to my personal opinions of CBS/Paramount's effort with this new offering.

Right on schedule, my new Blu-ray copies of Le Mans and Grand Prix arrived in the mail together as these two films were once again, ""connected at the hip"" as they have been through the decades.  For the less than $18 you can acquire this Blu-ray from Amazon during its initial release period, my title for this post says it all:  ""Don't hesitate, it's Magnifique!""

One expects an improved image on Blu-ray but I was stunned at how cinematically the final image was.  There is almost a perfect level of visual grain from beginning to end that creates what is so missing in many of today's CGI based motion pictures.  The look of film!  Special effects were all done in camera and look absolutely real in 1080P high definition.  The colors are rich and vibrant even considering the conditions the 1 million original feet of film was shot using now, 4 decade old techniques.  Flesh tones are spot on with Blacks deep and rich though there is occasional clipping during some of the night time scenes.  The Gulf Blue on the Porsches are dead accurate having seen the actual 917's at their namesake's museum in Zuffenhausen.

The clarity in some shots are truly amazing in the level of detail shown and even exposing close ups (06:23) that were originally shot with the camera's zoom lens I suspect, unintentionally mis-set at its starting rack focus point.  What some have described as ""soft.""  As many times as I have seen this film, the greatly enhanced picture (at times, video bandwidth indicating 30-33 mbs+ output) allowed me to see unexpectedly, background detail that had escaped notice during my many previous viewings such as the Black paint flaking off the right windshield pillar in Delaney's Porsche (24:21) or the exposed rivets/screws in same location on the Ferrari 512's (23:23).  Racecars are typically well worn devices and seeing detailing such as this adds greatly to the realism the film is attempting to create.

I also noticed for the very first time, B&W portraits of both Michael Delaney (McQueen at 59.28) and his main rival driving for Ferrari in the story, Erich Stahler (Siegfried Rauch at 1:00:24) hanging on the walls (Michael to the right of the sliding entry door; Erich's to the left of where Michael sits with Lisa) of the cafeteria where McQueen has about as much dialog as there is in any one section of the entire film. If CBS/Paramount used compression, it was very slight and one never sees any halo edge effects.  They allowed the transfer to breathe and the visuals certain confirm that.

As impressive as the visual transfer is short of a full frame by frame restoration which means there were occasional scratches in the final print though few and far between, the new lossless 7.1 audio mix is its equal.  The panning from one side of the room to the other (as well as rear to front) matching the cars going right to left on the screen was truly immersive during the driving sequences.  While I wasn't expecting my subwoofer to be exercised anywhere close to Tron:  Legacy, very pleasantly surprised whenever LFE was used.  For someone that used to clean out record grooves with liquids and brushes before playing to minimize background noise (ticks, pops) while maximizing available dynamic range, two sections of the film truly validates the life like audio free from recording hiss offered here even when sourced from older analog masters.  The first takes place at the start of the race from 25:54 when Michael closes the rear window in his 917 and one hears the rhythm of a beating heart increasing in rate until the flag is dropped to start the race (28:00).  The second is a repeat of this same sonic theme after the Ferrari 512 crashes off the race course with the driver attempting to escape the pending explosion (1:08:10-1:08:47).  With the noise floor so low, listen for the very subtle atmospherics throughout these and many other scenes which in a 7.1 system absolutely helps to create a sound field that has great width and depth completely enveloping the viewer. Consider it 3D for your ears and extremely effective.  Overall, for the era this film came from, CBS/Paramount did an excellent and highly effective remix.

In the end, what most amazed me during my nearly two hours watching Le Mans again, was how completely and unexpectedly I had been pulled back into this racing spectacle during my viewing.  The clarity of an updated Blu-ray worthy transfer, a new 7.1 lossless soundtrack, the perceived shortcomings from a lack of any dialog beyond the PA announcer in the background all contributed to producing for me, Steve McQueen's vision for his film:  The physical and emotional experience of actually participating as a driver in the 24 Hours of Le Mans from the comfort of one's own neighborhood (home?) theater.  Isn't that ultimately, the intended purpose of every motion picture.","Don't hesitate, it's Magnifique!",1306281600,155,

I was not disappointed. This is something like a modernized, diversified Black Adder-humor cop show. In other words, highly entertaining.

There is a fairly sizable cast of characters, most of whom are very good to excellent. The plots are varied, but generally nothing extraordinary (in either a negative or positive sense); the show relies more on the humorous interactions of characters, rather than the storyline of each episode, to foster enjoyment. That said, British humor, obviously, abounds, so, if that bores you, you probably won't like this; otherwise, you will likely enjoy it very much. This is not, imho, the best of British comedy; it is reminiscent of the Black Adder series in its puns, but, alas, the pupil does not outshine the master. One thing, I think, is that Atkinson is not reprising the role at which he most excels -- pseudo-villain. Aktinson's inspector is very good, but he is not the same caliber as the ""Black Vegetable"" -- not through a failing on the actor's part, but by the constraints of the script, which force him (as the part demands) to play a good guy, when he, as an actor, shines so as a villain. That is hardly a problem with either the plot or the acting, though -- just an observation on my part. :)

Also to be aware of, depending on the episode, there is a heavy reliance on sexual humor to draw laughs. Some episodes are better, some are worse, and sometimes this is funny, and sometimes it's not really.

All in all, I rate this a solid 4/5 stars, with some episodes eliciting side-splitting laughter, and others a quiet ""meh"".",Inspector Black Vegetable,1296259200,6,

Boy, the possibilities are almost endless with the number of catchy 'review headings' anyone can come up with -- both in favor of AND in disrespect to this movie. Based upon what I had read from others who had seen this film prior to its availability in DVD NTSC-1 encoding, I had originally planned to title my review as:

""The tele-'PHONE' is 'RING'-ing!""

-- or something to that effect, because one of the things most commonly heard about this movie was that it was basically another twist on Nakata Hideo's ""RING"" (which now seems to be becoming the new 'standard' by which ALL new Asian horror is to compared -- much like Sean Connery's ""James Bond"" being the ""OO7"" all subsequent assumers of the role are to be judged against, I suppose). I had to cancel the idea for such a title heading, however, once I had actually sat through the movie for the first time.

Without a doubt, there are a number of things reminiscent of ""RING"" -- most notably the 'vengeful spirit lashing out via some modern-day electronic device' (in this case, a cellular phone) and a female reporter associated with it intent on tracking the cursed technology back to its source (though not initially intended in this case, her actions instead being in response to a series of bizarre events; whereas the reporter in ""RING"" was investigating the legend of the 'cursed video' from the very beginning as part of her story).

A reporter named Ji-won, who exposes a ring of criminal activity of the worst kind, receives threatening calls from one of the perpetrators who got rounded up in the police sweep resulted from her expose. Though the harassing calls are coming from someone who makes it more than clear that she is being stalked, the reporter makes the unwise assumption that if she simply changes the number on her cell phone the angry party will eventually have to give up on trying to keep her in a state of fear and panic (she's led to believe that the danger is not real, and that the threats are only part of a psychological manipulation the criminal is playing). When she applies for the new number, only one particular number keeps appearing on the computer screen as being available. Time being precious as it is, she decides not to nit-pick over it and takes the number the computer glitch keeps coughing up.

Things then go from bad to worse, as she begins receiving a new set of calls on the new number. This has a very negative affect on little Yeong-Ju, the reporter's ""niece,"" who happened to be the very first person to answer the phone when it rang on the new number. As a result of what she heard on the other end of the line, the little girl experiences psychological trauma and undergoes some very disturbed & disturbing behaviors, which often expresses itself as fits of rage -- especially whenever her father becomes intimate with his wife. Psychological examinations show nothing to be too concerned about, suggesting that it is just a passing phase -- but as Yeong-Ju's behavior becomes more destructive (both self-destructive as well as projected outward) and more violent, her ""auntie"" uses her investigative skills as a reporter to track down the history of the phone number she adopted in order to determine what sort of connection it may have for the strange effect upon the little girl's mind. The answers she finds are not pretty, as everything comes full circle.

One of the things which bothered me at first, but then grew on me favorably, was the number of ""false climaxes."" Typically most people become annoyed by this sort of manipulation, but once this movie reveals its final secrets, you should wind up appreciating the beauty and mastery in the way each layer was pulled back and each new revelation led to the moment of ""orgasmic release,"" if you will.

Sure, there are those cliches which now come standard in your typical Asian ghost story fare. But, suffice it to say, although this movie is no ""RING,"" it is also no ""RING.""

P.S. -
You'll just adore (in an uneasy sort of way) the little girl who plays Yeong-Ju. You'll really feel for her even as you're being totally freaked-&-creeped by her. Wedding bells for Yeong-Ju and Toshio are surely in the making :)","Okay, no cutesy 'Review Title' this time....",1107475200,12,

There's pretty much a requirement to target the 18-35 year-old audience, and most people in that age group simply don't know enough about Johnny Cash and June Carter to appreciate their vast cultural significance and absolute authenticity.  But, since Cash was one of those rare artists who can truly be called larger than life (and death), he found admirers in that age bracket in the last decade or so of his life.  Still, that cult following isn't enough to fill movie theatre seats, so ""Walk the Line""'s creators were called upon to make some compromises while striving to evoke Cash's iconic integrity.

The result is a solid, enjoyable, and moving film that follows a familiar formula in celebrity biographies: big, pivotal scenes that show the protagonist's tough road to success, with less attention to the complex interaction of the individual artist with her or his culture.

Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix are, no surprise, much better looking and more glamorous, and far less earthy, than the people they are playing, but that doesn't bother me--it's Hollywood when all's said and done, and I'd rather see actors interpret their roles than to try imitating the inimitable.  Having said that, I'll stick with the general reaction and say that Witherspoon is more impressive than Phoenix because she is so much more natural and comfortable inside her character.  I respect Phoenix for doing his own playing and singing, but since I did see Johnny Cash in concert once (and hundreds of times on TV), I couldn't ever fully accept him as the Man in Black.  At the same time, I can't think of anyone who could have done better.  Playing God in a film would be easier than playing Johnny Cash!

The film is well-photographed, and the production design captures the various eras well, even if the film exhibits the sort of slickness and polish that today's moviegoers demand.  There is respect for Johnny Cash, along with an honest depiction of him as a deeply flawed, difficult man.  Supporting performances are strong overall, with the actor playing Cash's grudge-holding father doing well with a pretty one-dimensional role.  Most of all, there's the music, supervised by the great T-Bone Burnett.

""Walk the Line"" is a good, not great movie, but it will undoubtedly bring more believers to the shrine of the Man in Black, one of the most important musicians and songwriters of the second half of the 20th century.","A Respectable, Enjoyable Approximation",1151452800,4,

I don't think I need to give examples of what I mean when I say one's view of Jim Brown reveals no less than how he or she sees the United States.

While I recommend this documentary, I don't rate it higher because of the expectations I took to it.  JIM BROWN: ALL AMERICAN is a Home Box Office presentation of a Spike Lee film about Jim Brown, after all!  The quality of H.B.O. television is an oasis from the vast wasteland of the medium.  Spike Lee is one of our premiere filmmakers.  With such a creative force behind JIM BROWN: ALL AMERICAN, I envisioned nothing less than the movie version of Jim Brown's dead honest 1989 autobiography OUT OF BOUNDS, where with just words on paper the man flattened me, giving me an idea of how the football players whose tackles he so easily broke every season must have felt watching him hurtle by, let alone those who challenged him in other ways.

JIM BROWN: ALL AMERICAN has its moments, showing us this man who seems to have a wall between himself and you; at times even Jim Brown's children feel they must keep their distance. Yet with his ventures such as Amer-I-Can he reaches out, seeking to help others realize their potential. The wall keeping you from getting near Jim Brown seems to be just who he is, and those who try to penetrate it can end up like yet another gridiron defender tumbling in in grass and dirt, feeling foolish for trying to take him down.

On the whole, though, JIM BROWN: ALL AMERICAN does not keep up the intensity I anticipated.  But again, maybe I was just expecting too much.

I'll say this. Without blowing how JIM BROWN: ALL AMERICAN ends, its final scene touched me.  And when you see the film, you will know the emotional wallop with which it concludes comes not from what's obvious but because it takes you as close to Jim Brown as such a daunting man could allow.

4.0,True,"04 15, 2014",A311626XD2C4T2,B0059XTU3G,{'Format:': ' Blu-ray'},JordanJasper,"The second installment of Peter Jackson's 'Hobbit' trilogy improves upon the first lovely film in the sense that the action flows more convincingly and fans are treated to new vistas and never-before-visited destinations, all of which amount to a feast for the eyes and senses. I'll list the five best things about TDOS and then the two worst, in my opinion:

1. Martin Freeman's essay of the Bilbo character, full of superb idiosyncrasies and deft little comic flourishes, remains the rich, rewarding center of this epic treatment and keeps a lot of aspects of the film from possibly spinning off into superfluousness.

2. Benedict Cumberbatch's motion-capture interpretation of Smaug is nothing short of awe-inspiring. You believe this massive CGI dragon is REALLY that vain and REALLY living under that Lonely Mountain. Kudos to Cumberbatch and the effects team.

3. The action sequences featuring Legolas (a bit paunchier, but, hey), Tauriel, the barrel-run and the battles in LakeTown make for riveting cinema and are superbly paced. Speaking of pace ...

4. Lee Pace offers us a mesmerizing Thranduil, King of the Woodland Elves -- a haughty and ominous portrayal that makes me eager to see what he does with the character in the 3rd film.

5. Finally we get to imagine what it might be like for Gandalf to meet the resurgent Sauron head-on and their Light vs. Shadow duel (as well as the whole journey into Dol Goldur) was a very compelling use on the writers' parts of various non-Hobbit Tolkien canonical material to flesh this film out. Sweet. I look forward to seeing Galadriel coming to Gandalf's rescue ... which was foreshadowed in the first film. How will she (backed by the White Council) measure-up against the Necromancer? Hmmm...

The Two Most Unconvincing Things About TDOS:

1. What the first film lacked (at times) in forward momentum, it made up for with fabulously bucolic emotion. This film has little of that and, as a result, it lacks the trademark ""heart"" I've come to expect from Jackson, who has always been able to deftly blend his swashbuckling action with pathos.

2. I thought the whole LakeTown sequence and introduction of characters was tedious to the point of me getting up to fix myself a sandwich and not bothering to pause the Blu-Ray disc. Bard's family-life and the plot-point with Tauriel saving Kili with Athelas and the rest of the town, frankly, did not have a lot of spark (save for Legolas's action sequence). But I guess this was a necessary evil, the introduction of so MUCH LakeTown.

Anyhow, my quibbles are minor indeed. This is a worthy and resplendent epic by Peter Jackson and friends. It is not as ""classic"" as the LOTR films, in my opinion, then again it is difficult to compare them, given the differing demands of the source material. This is a must-own for filmgoers.

The most obvious change was the replacement of Dick York by Dick Sargent as Darren. York had a serious back problem that kept him from working, and facing pressure from ABC, both Liz Montgomery and Bill Asher had no choice but to replace him. This was also the year the Ashers made Ashmont Productions. This compnay would go on to produce the remaining years of ""Bewitched"". At the end of the 5th season Elizabeth and William Asher wanted to close production, but ABC, not wanting to lose a hit show, gave them part ownership of the series and huge salary increases.
 Another change was the show's opening. There is new animation featuring Samantha on her broom, along with the new ""Darren"", and we now have an announcer saying, ""Elizabeth Montgomery in...""Bewitched"""".
 30 episodes are included with this boxset and they look clean and crisp as if they were made yesterday. However, the scripts this season started to wane, as they are not as innovative and original as the five previous seasons. Still, if you are an ardent ""Bewitched"" fan, like me, pick up this season to help complete your collection.
 On a final note, since Marion Lorne had died it was important to have a ""dumb"" witch on the show. Alice Ghostley appears this season as Esmeralda, a witch with weak powers who fades whenever she gets nervous. Her performance is both funny and outrageous.
 On a sad note, this was also the year ""Bewitched"" lost a substantial portion of their audience. This was due to the recast of a major player in the series. The show finished at #25, after being at #12 the previous year: a loss of many million viewers.

Not only was it revolutionary new genre back in the mid 1920s, but it remains an outstanding silent film to this day, and is a shining example of how effective, dramatic and poignant a well-made silent film can be.  Without the medium of sound, silent film directors became very creative in the use of visual effects, and ""The Lodger"" boasts some excellent examples.  These were most probably inspired by German Expressionism, to which Hitchcock was exposed early in his career, and from which he took their effective use of light and shadow, unusual camera angles and visually expressive style to make good use in his own productions.  The shadowy look and solemn mood of typical German Expressionist films suit the theme of this Hitchcock thriller perfectly because it is based on the ever-popular story of Jack the Ripper.  On foggy Tuesday nights in London, young blonde girls are murdered by someone calling himself `The Avenger', and when a mysterious stranger arrives at a house looking for accommodation, the family begins to suspect their unusual lodger of being the killer.  Suspense and drama escalate in true Hitchcock fashion as the viewer wonders if he really could be the killer, and if so, what danger awaits the daughter of the family who is falling in love with the mysterious stranger.

More than just a typical Hitchcock thriller, ""The Lodger"" boasts all the best features of finest silent cinema, and it was the turning point in Hitchcock's career, being acclaimed as the greatest British film made up to that date in 1926.  Very good picture quality throughout is accentuated by perfect musical accompaniment to create the right mood, with even a choice of two different scores.  The many bonus features on this DVD add to the viewer's understanding of the film and of Hitchcock himself, with a 20-minute documentary focussing on ""The Lodger"" as well as interviews with Hitchcock, an audio commentary to the film and other exciting and unusual items.  Needless to say, this is an essential addition to any Hitchcock collection, but should not be overlooked by the general cinema enthusiast because silent films represent the foundation of modern cinema, and reveal the roots and early development of motion picture, as well as the various pioneers of the industry, Hitchcock being one of them.",Much more than a great Hitchcock thriller!,1235088000,20,

It deals with a lot of subjects that the black community is afraid or unwilling to discuss. Bill Duke (The Director) brings these subjects to the light and puts it right in your face. I do agree that the murder plot within this story was kind of distracting at times, but it all came together eventually, and it ultimately makes you re-think about the life you've led and who your sexual partners are. It sheds light on HIV and being tested, and it also exposes the ""DL"" lifestyle with black men who are secretly homosexual men who lead perfectly ""normal"" married hetrosexual lives in public, but they also secretly sleep with men. This movie also reveals that the reason for this behavior is that they are really afraid to be exposed because of the ridicule and persecution that they face from not only the community, but the church itself as well. This is definitely a topic that nobody wanted to touch, so I applaude Bill Duke for having the courage to go there. Let me just say that this movie is told in flashback fashion, so you must be paying close attention. Plus, this movie has an all star cast basically and you'll know what I mean if you watch a lot of black Cinema. There's Vivica A. Fox, Louis Gossest Jr., Clifton Davis (from Amen), Aunjanue Ellis, Paula Jai Parker and Leon (who I forgot was actually capable of real acting instead of just doing more biographies of singers and singing groups). This movie starts off with a woman named Valerie Maas being interrogated in the police station about a murder. The thing is, I think they mislead you intentionally into thinking the murder is her own husband, but in reality it's one of her husband's lover who's actually been murdered. I do have to get one gripe off my chest though, I do find it misleading that Dutch had been secretly sleeping with Ryan Chambers and his friend Kevin obviously (from my understanding of the movie anyway) but after he's caught by his wife Valerie she asks him if he used protection, and he admits not all the time or something to that effect. O.K! We find out that Ryan is HIV positive by his own admission, but somehow, after Dutch and Valerie both get tested the test come back negative. I don't see that was possible if he was messing around with Ryan too, and he obviously was by what they showed us. I had to get that out because it really bothered me that he was caught messing with an HIV positive man, but neither him or his wife was infected...I DON'T BUY THAT!

Moore,"As the negative reviews on this page make plain, there's a lot to quarrel with in Alex and Andrew Smith's ""The Slaughter Rule."" The film is essentially a series of intense set pieces, lacking a strong enough ending and narrative arc to tie them together into a cohesive, satisfying whole. The characters' tragedies and setbacks come unbelievably thick and fast, and large blocks of dialogue are lost because the Smiths encourage the actors to mumble inaudibly. Smaller things about the film also are bothersome, such as the Smiths' decision to saddle the protagonist with the joke name of Roy Chutney. (I kept expecting Uncle Allardyce Chutney and Cousin Clarence P. Chutney, played by W.C. Fields and Groucho Marx, to show up for a visit.)

Nevertheless, ""The Slaughter Rule"" manages to wield considerable power, thanks to the excellence of its ensemble cast. Mumble though they may, these are actors who know how to keep an audience mesmerized. David Morse gives the performance of his career as Gid, a grizzled, eccentric football coach and celibate gay man with a chaste but burning crush on Roy, his star quarterback. Gid's big speech, meant to reassure Roy about his intentions, instead comes across as a torch song, only serving to scare Roy all the more.

Ryan Gosling is equally compelling as Roy, continuing the extraordinary string of performances he began with ""The Believer"" and carried through ""Half Nelson,"" ""Fracture"" and ""Lars and the Real Girl."" I was also greatly impressed by the performances of Clea DuVall as the barmaid with whom Roy has a brief fling, Eddie Spears as Roy's best friend, Kelly Lynch as Roy's nasty mother, and David Cale as the town drunk, living out of an old Studebaker and sputtering his encyclopedic knowledge of classic country music. (Amy Adams is in the movie too, but you'll miss her if you blink.)

In the manner of so many great Hollywood classics, this film overcame an initial major hurdle when, after the film's director, David Miller, following dinner and discussion with the great actress, was reportedly told to leave in the most emotional terms by Crawford.
The basis for Crawford's strong creative disagreement with Miller, and what would be a pivotal element of the project, was Miller's belief that film newcomer Jack Palance would be ideal for her leading man.  As proof of his point, Miller had brought along a film for Crawford to watch after dinner, which was Palance's debut, ""Panic in the Streets.""  After viewing the film Crawford mistakenly believed that Miller had either Richard Widmark or Paul Douglas, longstanding film professionals, in mind to play opposite her, and was insulted when Miller suggested newcomer Palance.  Crawford reportedly also was turned off by Palance's appearance.
Miller finally got Crawford to see things his way and the rest is cinema history as both the great leading lady and Palance received deserving Oscar nominations for their brilliant performances.  Miller was shrewd enough to realize that an offbeat, terrifying looking leading man was just the antidote for Crawford, who therefore could appear vulnerable as was required by the exigencies of the story.  The fascinating element about Crawford in this film is that she appears appropriately terrified, forging an entirely different persona from the assertive executive female type she normally played who was in full command of her agenda.
The early phase of the film has a ""life imitates art"" aspect when Crawford, as Myra Hudson, a successful playwright, rejects actor Lester Blaine, played by Palance, for the lead in her Broadway play because he does not look appropriately romantic enough to play as leading man.  He angrily tells her before leaving the theater that he looks exactly like that legendary lover of old, Cassanova.
After Crawford's play opens to smashing reviews in New York she returns to her home in San Francisco, meeting Palance again as they are traveling on the same train.  The second meeting between them becomes so supercharged with emotion that Palance abandons plans to stop in Chicago, where a new job offer beckons, traveling instead to San Francisco with Crawford.
Myra Hudson comes from old San Francisco wealth.  This along with her rich play royalties make her an enticing catch for the opportunistic Palance, who in time proves he more than looks like Cassanova.  Before long the successful socialite and playwright becomes Mrs. Lester Blaine.
At that point Palance's old romantic flame from New York, Gloria Grahame, enters the scene.  They then plot to kill Crawford for her money.  Crawford learns about their plot when it turns up on her dictating machine, unknown to the plotters.
The story then enters a uniquely fascinating phase as Crawford seeks to use her playwright's imagination to concoct a scenario wherein the Palance-Grahame team will fail in their attempt and she will survive.  Many of the scenes contain little or no dialogue, with Crawford's expressive eyes revealed with haunting conviction as they register alternately sadness over being betrayed by someone to whom she gave her heart and fear over being killed by the ruthless team of Palance and Grahame, who are tough-willed and make it plain they will stop at nothing to achieve their objective of wealth at Crawford's expense.
In addition to pulsating drama, viewers are also treated to the beautiful scenery of San Francisco, which is captured magnificently by the camera's all-seeing eye.",Crawford in Brilliant Form,1025740800,6,

As is, the episodes are uncut and uncensored, though in later episodes they've blanked out some of the swear words (something that has become the norm in tv novelas from South America).

4.0,False,"10 25, 2004",A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B000069I09,{'Format:': ' DVD'},Dark Mechanicus JSG,"Roman Polanski stars and directs in this vicious, haunting little conte-cruelle set in Paris, in which a hapless, mild-mannered Parisian bureaucrat M. Trelkovsky (Polanski, channeling up Dustin Hoffman) rents an apartment whose previous tenant flung herself to her death from the bedroom window, and who now lingers comatose in the hospital, minutes from death. Trelkovsky negotiates a deal with merciless landlord Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas looming like an ancient human stormcloud), predicates it on the death of the hapless former tenant Simone Choule, and moves in on the news that the woman is dead and cold. Freakiness ensues.

Warning: this movie is vintage Polanski, very textured, very detailed, very meticulous, exceptionally deranged and disturbing---but not for the impatient. For best results, wait for an overcast day with the wind roaring in the trees and the rain pattering against the window, get a fire roaring in the hearth, drink some well-aged Scotch, and sit back and truly ensconce yourself in the weirdness.

""The Tenant"" is a waking nightmare in which you can't help but feel pity---and unfolding horror---for the dreamer.

Every one of us, I think, has had an experience with a nightmare landlord. When I was a feckless undergraduate, I rented an apartment from a miserly but prominent lawyer, a wretched creature straight from Dickens who materialized on my doorstep at 2 in the morning hours after I had called to warn him of my pipes bursting. The man was about 150 years old, full of scowling fury, and cursed at me to get a bucket as I was a ""useless, philandering young fool"" and had destroyed his apartment---despite the fact that the pipes were later found to have been indifferently maintained for decades.

The simple question at the dark heart of ""The Tenant"" is this: at what point are we ourselves? How much of ourselves must we sacrifice---at work, at play, in our daily lives---to live in society? At what point to we cease to be? Trelkovsky, eager to please, diffident in all aspects of his life and his civil-service job, anxious to avoid offense, lounges drunk on the bed of his lover (the astonishing Isabelle Adjani, here hopelessly gorgeous) and wonders by what right he considers himself---his being, his soul, his identity---to reside in his head. Why not the nose? The body? The arm? Or perhaps the tooth, one of which he finds concealed in a hole drilled into the apartment wall, swathed in a cotton ball, hidden behind the heavy wardrobe of the apartment's doomed former tenant.

Worse still, poor Trelkovsky suffers the renter's worst nightmare: he doesn't even have a toilet in his apartment, and has to make a sojourn through ill-lit, peeling hallways to go to the bathroom.

Director Polanski is note-perfect as the meek and meticulous Trelkovsky, eager to please, anxious to avoid offense. And equally note-perfect is Polanski's meticulous attention to detail in the atmosphere of malice: a harmless, noisy house-warming party brings the wicked attention of his draconian neighbors upon him, earns him the disdain of the matronly concierge (Shelley Winters, who shuffles and ambles and grumbles with lugubrious alacrity), and merits a nasty warning from his landlord. Worse follows his refusal to sign a petition against a supposedly ""noisy"" neighbor, and Trelkovsky finds himself constantly warned against making too much noise, consequently relegated to scuttling quietly about like a mouse in his own apartment.

""The Tenant"" is an invitation to follow Trelkovsky into a cycle the hapless renter should be familiar with: righteous indignation, an eagerness to please and forge allies, and ultimately a descent into obesssion and madness. Why does the local cafe insist on serving Trelkovsky hot chocolate and Marlboro smokes, both favored by his suicidal predecessor? What is the meaning of the late-night tenants who stand for hours in the communal restroom, looking for all the world like 16th century Russian Icons, standing like friezes, not moving a muscle? And why does Trelkovsky wake from tortured dreams to find himself cloaked in Simone's nightgown, his fingernails painted, his face rouged?

The transfer on this skeletal DVD is gorgeous---the film looks like it could have been shot yesterday---though there are certainly problems, not least of which is the paucity of features on this otherwise crazily intriguing, often baffling little sliver of cinematic grue. Polanski, already in the throes of legal difficulties over his alleged pedophilia in the United States, had fled to France, and the film was shot in French as ""Le Locataire"". Alas, the only DVD you can find of this brutal little gem is dubbed atrociously in English. Polanski, Douglas, and Winters all speak their lines in English, but it's jarring to hear French gens-d'armes barking out Brooklyn-esque brogues, and it takes you completely out of the movie to hear a clearly French waiter's request voiced like an Imperial Stormtrooper from ""Star Wars"".

But these are minor quibbles, and the character of Monsieur Trelkovsky is without question goes down in a fearsome triumvirate of disturbing cinematic cross-dressers, ranked with Norman Bates and Buffalo Bill. For the patient, ""The Tenant"" is a study of cold, congealed horror, and well worth the price of rent.",And you thought *your* Landlord was rough!,1098662400,9,

Brokaw makes a dismal attempt at objectivity in this documentary acutely because he is an apologist for this distinct functionalist quasi-religion.

Of course the real Frida was not nearly as gorgeous and appealing as Salma Hayek makes her out to be, but the spirit of the artist is faithfully rendered: this was one beautifully ballsy woman who lived life by her own rules and heart, who gave all the oppressive and conformist social/gender conventions of her society a big bold middle finger, who lived as she painted: passionately, torturously, and triumphantly.

Love him or hate him, his movies are their own thing and all of this obsession for spaghetti Westerns and Chop-socky martial arts films etc. would be for nought if he wasn't also a superb filmmaker.  All of this is on display, for good or ill, in Django Unchained.  Yes, it is over-the-top bloody to the point of parody.  It is also funny as hell.  And finally, it is one of the more honest depictions of the sheer brutality of slavery ever put on a film, and a perfectly raised middle finger to the romantic fantasy of Gone With the Wind and the decades of whitewashed history of that loathesome institution.

Thank heavens Tarantino and Christoph Waltz found each other.  He is absolutely wonderful here and Quentin has a fine actor who obviously relishes delivering Tarantino's delicious dialogue. It was one of those fortuitous meetings of talent that bring to mind Ford & Wayne and Scorcese & Deniro, a perfect blend of author and actor.  Sam Jackson is equally fine as always as a vehicle for whatever Tarantino needs from him.  Jamie Foxx plays well as Django, and Leonardo DiCaprio is up to the task as a vile slave master couching his own brutality in the trappings of wealth, privilege and overly fine manners. The character puts the lie to all that antebellum Southern plantation finery built upon a lie and the most detestable social construct imaginable.

But, that is the sober underpinnings to a typical Tarantino outing of politically incorrect dialogue and action, near cartoonish violence, and hilariously imagined situations and characters.  This isn't history, but with all the incongruous dialogue and attitudes for the period, it somehow hits a truth often missed in more period centered films.

Tarantino's films aren't for everyone.  The violence is excessively bloody, which will offput many.  I found it so overly bloody that it is obviously movie violence taken to the nth degree, and thus manifestly make-believe.  But, I don't know how that would apply to or effect impressionable minds (a discussion we will have for a long time).

I have always gone to Tarantino's movies expecting to dislike them and he always seems to win me over with the unexpected humor and the bravado and sheer inventiveness of the enterprise.  For a filmmaker with a reputation for violent action, I've never seen one who more effectively employs the closeup as a technique.  He loves to get right up in his actors faces as they deliver his wonderful lines.  And in every movie he will throw in something so unexpectedly funny as the scene here of Big Daddy's night riders bitching about the holes cut in the sacks they're wearing over their heads not allowing them to see where they're going.  That and many other non sequiters and assorted cleverness strewn through his films keeps me coming back.",Quintessential Quentin...,1357862400,37,

After an encounter with the Joker ends tragically, Batman returns to Gotham City. 5 years pass, and there's a turf war being waged between a wealthy crime lord called the Black Mask, and another crime lord named the Red Hood. However, Red Hood also acts as a vigilante with intentions on cleaning up Gotham City, but he doesn't follow Batman's ethical code, and he uses excessive force. His violent tactics have put him at odds with Batman. But what exactly is Red Hood after? -summary

This movie borrows heavily from two Batman storylines: A Death in the Family and Under the Hood. Fans of the comic will more than likely have an idea what's going to happen. However, despite having some knowledge of the storylines the plot is constantly moving to keep the interest level high. Even the character interactions can be very entertaining when the action finally takes a back seat.

The first thing I noticed about the movie were the visuals. The animation is not of the same anime style as Gotham Knight. It's more of the traditional Batman: The Animated Series style which I was very glad to see. The visuals are impressive when delivering some very fluid and incredible action scenes. I mean wow, the creative juices were flowing when it came down to the combat.

The choreography at times is like poetry in motion. The battles move with such grace that small details could be missed during the hand to hand exchanges, if one doesn't have a quick eye. The action scenes also didn't contain the slightest amount of re-used cels, and the animation was still fluid during battles taking place with multiple characters. The eye candy doesn't end there. I also think the CG and 3D blended in quite well during the high speed vehicle chases. One thing is for certain, the action junkies are going to feel their money was well spent.

Normally, a great soundtrack can bring out the best in most mediocre action scenes. However, it's the reverse in this case. The top notch action scenes actually help the soundtrack. Now don't take this the wrong way, I don't exactly find the BGM which was done by Christopher Drake to be bad; but it sounds way too similar to his other works with very little variation. The artwork and character designs are very consistent, and appear to be a step up when compared to Batman/Superman: Public Enemies and also Green Lantern: First Flight.

I'm sure someone is wondering by now, ""is the action all there is to this?"". Not at all, at least I don't think so. The character development and characterization are very good as well. I won't spoil the things Red Hood does; but his character is portrayed as someone whom means business. In his first appearance, it's obvious he is not someone to fool around with. He caught my eye rather quickly and I enjoyed his antics.

Casual fans whom are not into the comic will probably get an idea on why Batman has such a huge following. He's by far one of the most human characters in comic books, and the way he deals with his failure is so realistic. The Joker seems to be quite different here. Unlike his usual character in the animated series, where he's depicted as being insane,as well as a clown with a sick twisted sense of humor. Here, he seems to be based off of Heath Ledger's Joker; sadistic, unpredictable, and very violent.

This is the area where some diehards will probably feel sour about the film, and it happens to be the voice acting. Now, the voice work is solid overall, but there is slight inconsistency at times that I was able to pick up, mainly concerning Batman whom is voiced by Bruce Greenwood. Still, I think he does a good job. Fans of the Joker will probably miss Mark Hamill, but John DiMaggio grew on me rather quick. This version of the Joker had the sinister voice to match his actions.

I have small issues with the film. I think everything was too spelled out and predictable. It was no secret who was under the hood obviously; but I think his intentions were too easy to catch. I also noticed at least one awkward story element that had me scratch my head a bit. In addition, as good as the action scenes are they can be a bit too highly exaggerated, with these regular people performing moves at a superhuman level.

This part isn't exactly a con for me personally, because I prefer my dark superheroes to be in a dark atmosphere; but this is mainly a heads up for certain individuals. Although this is a cartoon that is based on a very popular superhero. I don't think it's child friendly at all. The dialogue can be quite violent at times along with the action. There are graphic deaths here with people being shot and blood splattered on the wall. The death scenes aren't as over the top as most anime series, but I think parents should know that it's present.

Overall, I was heavily impressed by this film. It gave me what I wanted and then some. It does have its flaws and of course they will vary from person to person, but this is something that is staying in my collection and DC in my view continues to dominate Marvel in the animated department.

Pros: Action packed, dark, violent, very good sound effects

Cons: Very predictable and too spelled out, inconsistent voicework, not child friendly",The Dark Knight's greatest failure.,1427760000,,

The movie itself is entertaining to watch, the music is just fantastic, and the dance sequences are spot-on.  The costumes, digital effects and art direction are interesting and tasty.  I enjoyed seeing Andre move around the screen.  They have all of the elements here to make an outstanding, spectacular musical that could have put Chicago to shame.

But it didn't.

The problem lies in the script and director.  First of all, there were scenes that were simply out of order.  Characters had information before they should have.  Had they flipped the scenes around, it would have nudged closer to fulfilling its promises.  But there are some basic directing pitfalls from which a lot of new filmmakers suffer.  Not enough time passes.  Days lasted entirely too long.  Many individual scenes go on too long, thereby omitting the opportunity for a new scene that would have better developed the characters and plot.

There are some technical flaws as well.  There's a night scene early on that uses rack focusing to draw your attention between characters.  However there's one angle that has neither character in focus and jars you out of the scene.  There's a great profile master shot between Andre and Ben Vereen is overly backlit thereby washing out the characters.

And Ben Vereen is simply wasted in this movie.  He plays one note.  Had the script been allowed to breathe, they could have given him life and the opportunity to shine.  There's neither growth nor resolution with Ben.  In fact, most of the movie suffers from a lack of growth.

Terrence Howard gets off to a rocky start.  His character is far too stiff jawed.  By the end of the movie he finds his cool and salvages the role from its poor direction.

Antwan Patton dominates when performing, but he winds up a frustration in character development.  He meanders through the dramatic scenes lacking purpose.

There is nudity in the film that feels thrown into the mix for nudity's sake.  It felt gratuitous and unnecessary.

This is supposed to be a musical.  But the script doesn't take advantage of the musical numbers as a device to advance the story.  Yet the musical scenes that were included were so well done, so exciting, they left me wanting more.

Each episode has the common organization plan of the short story. The ground is set, the characters are introduced, the issue or a complication is introduced, a crisis or two looms, there are signs and then appearance of a climax and then there may or may not be a resolution, a moral, a sense of wonder, anger, pity, awe, disgust, horror or amusement.

And all that happens within thirty minutes of slow or fast possible real life or impossible real life situations which move as fast or as slow as their wont.

The writers have moved beyond literature into the realm of moving pictures or they have moved from moving pictures into the realm of literature successfully. The fact that they appear as the characters, the heroes or the anti-heroes, the narrators and the actors, the audience and the pictures on the screen adds to the flavour of the viewer being able to identify with them no matter how grotesque, macabre or common place they may be.

The episodes/stories show conscious or Freudian or maybe even Jungian influences of Edgar Allan Poe, Lord Dunsany, H.H. Munro, John Collier, Robert Bloch, or just the depravity of the creator(s).

Director Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jr. (reprising Tony Stark/Iron Man) dare to give the man behind the iron mask a mission besides saving the world: saving himself, with a little help from unexpected friends.

As the story begins, Tony Stark faces the consequences of revealing his Iron Man identity.  The government and a rival arms inventor (an over-the-top Sam Rockwell) want the suit; a revenge-seeking Russian physicist (a perfectly cast Mickey Rourke) is after Tony; and Tony himself is being poisoned by the miniature nuclear reactor that keeps him alive.  Tony slowly self-destructs, wrecking his business, his relationships with long-suffering personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Air Force buddy Rhodey (Don Cheadle), and finally his status as Iron Man.

At rock bottom, Tony gets a hand up from Colonel Nick Fury of SHIELD (a nicely restrained Samuel L. Jackson).  Fury provides Tony with a means, and a motivation, to work out his own salvation.  En route to a smashing finale, Tony gets a key assist from Fury's undercover contact inside Stark Industries.  As enigmatic SHIELD agent Black Widow, Scarlett Johansson is ""all that"" in a form-fitting unitard; her thrilling hallway fight sequence might have been the centerpiece of a movie with less visual firepower.

Examples include ""Biohunter"", ""Twilight of the Dark Master"", and, yes, ""Demon City Shunjuku"". Putting aside all prejudices that might hinder my enjoyment of the film, I watched this movie. What did I think of it? Not very much.
It isn't the cliched plot that's the biggest problem, because some of the best anime out there is practically riddled with cliches. The biggest problem is the characterization, or, more correctly, lack thereof. None of the characters felt real to me; all of them were cardboard cutouts with little or no substance. This could be largely contributed to the lackluster English voice acting, which seems to have zero emotion or motivation whatsoever. Even in battles or emotional scenes, whenever someone opened his or her mouth, the dramatic tension just falls apart. That's how weak the voice acting sounds. And the love story between the two main characters? Very underdeveloped, unsatisfying, and just plain flat.
Speaking of dramatic tension, there practically is none in this movie. When the hero fought a demon in the subway, I was expecting something dramatic to happen, such as (but not limited to) the hero awaking his powers to slay the monster. Instead a combination of the hero's flimsy power, electrified rails, and a hand granade thrown in the demon's mouth killed it. It was just so anti-climactic. When the hero finds his father's powerful weapon, we're supposed to feel glad for him. But the way the scene was presented, I couldn't have cared less. Nothing managed to build up in that ""powerful"" moment. And I won't even mention the ending, except that it's one of the worst endings I've ever seen in anime.
Finally, the plot. It tried to fit so much into such a limited time, and this was a bad move. The characterization might've been saved if the film had been just a little bit longer, but that isn't the case. There was so much potential in this movie, and it was lost because of the shortness of the film.
To put it simply, ""Demon City Shinjuku"" was disappointing. It's interesting to watch once, but then you'll quickly realize how underdeveloped this film really is.

5.0,True,"08 10, 2012",A3OLP2A09TCFU9,B001BYLFDA,,Autumn Witch,"I just love this film and as I get older I like it more and more. Even though I haven't worked in the USA for years and years, the years I have I can so relate to this film. When it first came out I loved it and now I use words like genius to describe it. Captures both the cooperate culture and chain restaurant industry so well it's almost scary.

The story follows a group of people working at the lower corporate level a tech firm in the 90's. I just so happened to work for tech firms in the 90's and although all of them weren't like this, the majority were. But as long as you have worked at any business in the corporate office level you will get a kick out of this film. It covers all the normal office politics, annoying office mates, type A personalities, horrible upper management, worker bees and everyone else you will find in this environment.

The main characters are a low lever programmer and his work mates. The main antagonist is of course the boss and his minions but its more a statement of a man exploring his place in life and where he really would like to be. And surprisingly his desire is not to be rich and powerful but just in a position to enjoy life at his own pace.

There is also a peripheral character who works as a waitress at a chain restaurant similar to TGI Friday's or Applebee's. Anyone who has ever worked in the restaurant industry will really appreciate this story line and the truths it reveals through her tormentuous struggle.  Just brilliant!

Also, I have to comment briefly on this version the Bluray, ""with Flair"" edition. Even a film of this calibre benefits from such a beautiful picture. They did a very nice transfer.

I am not one of those people who like the commentary on most of these types of things but Mike Judge and the rest of the cast did a nice modern update for this edition and it was neither too long or self promoting. I really enjoyed it.

And lastly, the deleted scenes were really funny!

But being a fan of Patrick McGoohan's ""The Prisoner"" and ""Secret Agent"" series, and knowing of the awesome reputation of The Avengers, I gave it a try. I decided to go for the whole Emma Peel set at once instead of trying the individual volumes first. I regret it now. I watched several episodes, and while they were mildly entertaining, they lack realism, to say the least. This is one of those fake shows where you can obviously spot the stand-in who comes in every few minutes to double for the actors anytime they're required to fall down or get in a fight. They give a top hat and umbrella to a stuntman who looks nothing like Patrick MacNee, film him from behind and we're supposed to be fooled into thinking it's him, I guess. This happened so much that I wondered why the wimpish MacNee even bothered to show up for filming. Also, the painted backdrops used as scenery are so cartoonishly fake that they're laughable. Any time you see an open door or window, you'll see the badly-painted 'outdoor scenery', wobbling on the soundstage as if it's about to fall down. I understand that they probably had a fairly low budget, but most of it is just unexcusably bad. The Prisoner and Secret Agent never looked this phony, probably because McGoohan cared more about realism than cuteness. Another major problem I had was with MacNee. His bland, unoriginal acting style is mediocre at best, and he gives the impression, to me at least, that he would probably have been an unpleasant person in real life. Wrong guy for the part; it is totally unbelievable to me that a beauty like Emma Peel would be interested in an ugly, creepy fop like Steed. How MacNee got the part, I'll never know. I found myself watching the show just to see Diana Rigg, a charming actress who did the best she could with the often poor scripts. There is a subtle charm to some of the episodes, the ones that were well-written like Cybernauts, but too many of them are ludicrously plotted and laughably acted. The shows are all riddled with hero/villain guy clichs: bad guys kick, punch, and shoot at at the heroes, but can do no damage, while the heroes can easily knock a guy out cold with only a fake karate chop to the neck, and they have perfect aim every time when shoooting a gun. I was expecting the Vulcan nerve pinch at any moment. It's *really* phony stuff, unwatchable to me. I could only make it through about 10 of these DVDs, trying to give the show a fair chance, but soon I knew I was done with The Avengers for good. I've sold my set, I gave up on them and won't miss them. I can see why so many people like the show, they like the style it had, the actors, and the occasionally well-written storyline, but those of us who need an acceptable amount of realism in shows we watch should stay away, unless you want to weed through dozens of boring, ridiculous episodes to get to the few classics. I don't demand complete realism at all times, or expensive production values, but Steed being a stud, and fake painted blue skies with fake painted clouds as backdrops...come on. I guess if you accept the pair as infallible superheroes, and the show as nothing but a live-action cartoon, and that's *all* you expect, you might like this show. But personally, I found the tremendous reputation of The Avengers to be unfounded.

Graduate Thesis Film came into mind while I was watching this movie - which starts out with a well dressed man staring out into the ocean before he starts walking into it.  His body is discovered presumably by his son, Theo - who is nine years old at the time.
Ten years pass and Theo, now around 19, is orpahned again when his mother passes away.  Amongst her belongings, which are kindly given to him by her mother's boyfriend, is a super eight movie of his father dancing and looking like he's in love with the person who shot the film, which gets accidently incinerated - but not before Theo can use his cell phone to snap of shot of his father in love.
Now here's why I say Graduate Thesis Film:  There is a visible-to-the-viewer-only one man guitar player and singer who acts as the Greek Chorus.
Theo wants to find out who the person is his father was so deeply in love with.  None of his deceassed parents' friends will tell him.  So he does a bit of detective work, including having a chat with a hypochondriac, that gives him a name - George Walter.
Don't break out the hankies quiet yet.  George was in love with Theo's Dad; but it was an unconsumated love because Theo's Dad suffered from manic depression and neither he or George had the courage to act on their unspoken, yet acknowledged love.
George, who just happens to be the author of a cult novel, lives by himself in a mountain retreat.  Theo tracks him down and begins the slow process of drawing out the man who his father loved.
Theo doesn't know what to make of George who seems to have given up on living.  George seems to be also in love with Theo.  Together, the two do move on with their lives until it seems that Theo is fed up with George and pushes them both towards a solution where they part while moving forward with their lives - though the ending is a bit muddled.  There is a mystery man George meets at the end.  Is it an older Theo?  Not really sure.
""The Hour of Living"" could have been so much more.  It presents an intriquing mystery - could have done without the Greek Chorus - that gets derailed by dribbling mindless philosophy.  I'm sure Sebastian Michael, who wrote and starred in this movie, got an A from his professor.
I would have given him a C.

However, I love a good musical biopic and STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is certainly that. For those few unaware, ""Straight Outta Compton"" was the debut album (and title track) from rap group NWA, with members Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, MC Ren, and DJ Yella (there might be more, but the film focused on those five). It tells the story of how the group came together, created some of their hit records, and broke up due to various reasons, mainly involving money and contracts. If that sounds like a lot to fit into a two and a half hour movie, you'd probably be right. It doesn't just stop with NWA's breakup, then following the solo careers of the three most important members. If there's a strike against the movie, it's that there was too much ground to cover and not enough time to do it satisfactorily. Still, the performances were excellent and I thought the actors did an incredible job of inhabiting their real-life counterparts. It should also go without saying that the film has stellar soundtrack. Narratively, the film seems to focus the most on Eazy-E, who the film is dedicated to, and most of the best moments involve him. There were many great moments, in fact, ranging from elation and awe, to a few that will probably have you tearing up. As for the film's Oscar snub, I can see why many felt it deserved a nod, but it honestly was a little too overreaching and bloated. Entertaining and fulfilling? Yes, but not necessarily Oscar-worthy. However, Jason Mitchell (Eazy-E) was most definitely snubbed. Overall, I feel like NWA's story would have been better served as a miniseries, considering how complex and large in scope the narrative is, but there is a 20-minute longer Director's Cut that I will be checking out in the near future. As for what I just watched, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is a fascinating look at the rise of some music legends, an intimate look behind the curtain of the music business, and a loving tribute to a friend.","A flawed, but loving, tribute to Eazy-E",1462665600,4,

No doubt in my mind that part one is classic, part two was plagued by stale acting but blessed with awesome gory & unique kills and part three, well at least it still has Danielle Harris in it! Seriously though all jokes aside, the acting is definitely a step up from part 2 but honestly the kills were nothing special this time around. Okay, I mean one guy gets his head cut in half and his brain falls out and another gets paramedic chest paddles to the head that makes it explode, other then that most kills are generic. I felt that even the gore was a step down from the previous films which was disappointing as well.

I'm really not trying to bash the film because I love Adam Greens work and the Hatchet series but part three was kind of a let down for me and if this is truly the end then yes, I am disappointed that the creativity of the kill scenes are not unique and as memorable as part one and two.

The pacing was good and never was I bored with the film, I did however dislike the actor who played the Sheriff, I didn't think he was that great, and I couldn't wait for the Swat team leader to get killed, he was over the top annoying.

It has a look and feel of the older classic horror films, which is very much appreciated. It's a throwback to the older classic 70's and 80's horror films. The film is played serious, and although it does have moments of humor, it's not cheesy !

I usually rent these type of films to make fun of them, ""cough cough"" megadinosaur vs megashark ""cough couch"" so I thought, a horror film with a giant Bunnyman, this has got to be a train wreck. However when it started, and the super 8 footage started playing, I immediately knew that this wasn't some cheesy b-movie shlock, and that a lot of heart and effort was put into it. (on a side note, I haven't seen the DVD, but I heard that there's a ton of extra's that show the brutal honesty of what it's like to make a low budget horror film, so I have to check that out, however at this writing amazon is sold out again, argh) anyway back to topic at hand....

The main thing I took away from the film, is that the Bunnyman character is intriguing, and I would like to see more of him. There's a lot of psychological things going on, like when he's reluctant to take off his Bunny mask during the table scene. yes it's straight out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but with a cool twist, which brings me to my next point, this film seems to be about contradictions. The theme of contradiction comes to play repeatedly in the film. We see a giant Bunny costume, and we think it's innocent, then it proceeds to rip a girl in half. We expect this film to be cheesy, it's not. We expect Bunnyman to die at the end of the film, like the antagonist in 99% of horror films do, which he does not. This is what I enjoyed most about the film, I never knew what was going to happen.

When the scene of some young blonde woman is captured and about to be tortured (yes we have seen this thousands of times) the Bunnyman character comes onto screen, starts playing classical music, and brings out his chainsaw, then I realized, well I haven't seen that before..... and that's what I like the most about this film, it lures you in the with familiar
preconceived notions of the horror films we've seen countless of times, but then it veers of the path into something unique and different.

Yes, this is a low budget horror film, which I find adds to it's charm. It's has a more gritty, realistic feel to it, instead of the overly stylized modern horror films. It looks great, and the filmmakers seem to have gone for broke when shooting it, from car chases to blood, lots and lots of blood. This was a breath of fresh air in a genre really needing to change things up. Who knew it would come from a giant seven foot tall Bunnyman :)",surprisingly good,1308614400,,

I first saw the movie a long time ago, and I remember thinking that the first half-hour was kind of slow, but the rest of the movie was great. Seeing it again a few days ago, I'd have to revise that opinion. The first half hour isn't especially suspenseful, but it does set up the story well. A group of waylaid, desperate losers are stuck in a remote South American town, trying to find a way out.

Seeing a very young Yves Montand at the beginning of his career is certainly fun. The other characters (including Vera Clouzot, the director's wife, together with a multi-national, multi-lingual supporting cast) are well-chosen and move the tale along nicely.

The suspense that made Wages of Fear such a hit in the '50's builds toward the middle of the film, as many of the guys accept an offer to drive flasks of nitroglycerine along bumpy, treacherous mountain roads in order to reap $2000 rewards.

The trouble with the movie isn't really its own fault. It's ours. Most of us have been raised on far more intensely suspenseful films over the past few decades. Spoiled, you might say. So Wages of Fear, while a pleasantly enjoyable movie, just doesn't feel as ""edge-of-the-seat"" now as it must have 60 years ago. Maybe we've become too jaded. There was a point when I couldn't help saying to myself ""You know, this whole tension thing is based on a bunch of cheap props (the supposed flasks of nitroglycerine) that probably have water in them,"" In other words, the film is a little dated and not 100% convincing now.

There are undoubtedly reasons to see the movie. For one thing, Henri-Georges Clouzot was a fascinating director who bears comparison to Hitchcock. For another, the whole plot is so pleasantly weird for its time, and even today. As a ""history of cinema"" type movie, it also has its appeal.

It's the story of a group of American soldiers who are behind enemy lines and trying to make it back to their side. This relatively short film (60 min.) shows aspects of Kubrick's future interests in cinematography and story telling. It's not as refined as his later works, but it shows Kubrick's grasp of the language of film and his talent for conveying something beyond the norm. This black and white film is interesting given that at times it seems to be a blend of early silent film's stylistic qualities contrasted with more contemporary naturalistic film making.

The picture quality is excellent with good contrast, though as with the Kino aesthetic the images have not been totally cleaned of the specks of dust on the film.

Outstanding acting from its two main players, each earning an Academy Award nomination for their efforts, the film is careful to build an intricate story that unfolds in a uniquely unpredictable manner.

Milo Tindle (Michael Caine) is invited to Andrew Wyke's (Laurence Olivier) secluded mansion to discuss Milo's desire to marry Andrew's wife Marguerite. Andrew is a detective fiction novelist who prides himself on solving dastardly crimes with his main character Sinjon Lord Merrydew, while Tindle owns a local salon. Well aware of his wife's frivolous activities and her infatuation with riches and exquisite possessions, Andrew offers Milo an opportunity to burglarize some expensive jewels (170,000 pounds worth) so that Milo can live happily with Marguerite, and Andrew can collect the insurance money and live happily with his mistress Teia. But not everything is as it seems, especially when the game-obsessed Andrew convinces Milo to use a clown costume and dynamite to stage the robbery; and add to that a tumultuous recreation of a downstairs fight with a fireplace poker and a pistol. A riveting contest of deadly one-upmanship ensues with unforgettable twists and an unparalleled conclusion.

Expertly directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and based on the play by Anthony Schaffer, the film opens with delightfully circus-tinged music that lends itself throughout the entire film to mix up the tone as each of the characters transition from serious to comical. Tindle starts with a serious demeanor and is instantly weary of Andrew's proposition, but with his whimsical and carefree manner, Milo soon dons a surprising mask of laughable lightheartedness, joining in with dancing about and playful mockery. The interactions between the two constantly change from the serious tone of adultery to the nonchalant air of jocose buddies.

The film is essentially only two people in a single location, and yet it never slows and never misses a beat, staying relentlessly engrossing. The mansion is filled with toys, odd dcor and games - games being the focal point of the film. The design of the rooms is fantastic, with creepy dolls, mystifying puzzles, and electronic puppets, including Jolly Jack Tar the sailor, a particularly eerie life-size monstrosity that laughs and claps his hands at the touch of a button. These complex games emphasize the seriousness of the game played by Andrew, one easily crossing the line of a harmless practical joke. But even when the initial game concludes, another is started and the film is careful to never let you know when a game is over and who is about to win. Initially, more than winning and losing, it is the excitement of playing the game that thrills Andrew, and the audience is spellbound watching it unfold.

With flawless performances by both Caine and Olivier and unbelievably intelligently scripted Shakespearean dialogue, Sleuth redefines audience immersion into a film in which the plot keeps thickening. Perhaps the most astoundingly coincidental moment of the film is early on when Olivier mentions that in years to come their roles might be reversed, and Milo will be the one fending off admirers of his trophy wife. 2007 marks the release of the remake of this 1972 classic, and Michael Caine ironically returns to play the role Olivier unquestionably perfected.

After seeing The Sundowners, I wanted to see the movie that Mitchum and Kerr had been in before The Sundowners.  They are both remarkably versatile actors!  They couldn't be more different on this and The Sundowners!  For the entire movie (Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison), the characters call each other ""Ma'am"" and ""Mr. Allison"" (he calls her ""Sister Angela"" only once or twice).  It's interesting that the same director, John Huston, did another movie with the characters addressing themselves formally on their adventures:  The African Queen.  The camerawork does really well at creating a first-person feeling by bobbing as Mr. Allison moves and viewing the Japanese from his vantage point, as well as almost always putting him and the nun (Kerr) in close contact, so you feel like you're with them.  Kerr does a good job revealing the fear her character has, adding depth to what could be just a bland and stuck-up personality.  She puts on an Irish accent but doesn't make it sound silly like an actor's natural tendency might be.  I really like the military aspect of this movie, for Mitchum has to make brief incursions into Japanese territory without being discovered.  It's more of a human interest story than a romance, and like the Gregory Peck-Audrey Hepburn movie Roman Holiday, stresses the supremacy of duty over personal feelings.  ""The joy is in the journey"", as they say.  And I suppose the one good long-term thing Mr. Allison gets out of the adventure is a personal experience with God, which he'd never had before (hence the title).  The back of the DVD says it offers a ""surprising blend of suspense and humor"", which sums it up nicely.",Intriguing,1316304000,5,

You may remember this as Sylvester Stallone's forerunner to Arnold Schwarzenegger's comic book turn in Batman & Robin, if your fortunate you don't. It would be a misnomer to say that time has been unkind to Judge Dredd as 1995 wasn't too kind to it either.
 Making his Demolition Man look like intellectual high art in comparison, Stallone stars as Judge ""Joseph"" Dredd, I place the name in quotes because no where in the Dredd mythology I have seen on line tells me that he has a first name let alone such a generic one, I would have gone with Zowie or Starbuck if I had been the writer. Anyway, in this grim, but colorful future, society has run amok with most people living inside closed off mega cities, those not so lucky live in the post-apocalyptic world outside called ""the cursed Earth"". The Judges are a band of elite cops, who also act as jury and executioner, there are no defenses, pardons or what not, still everyone pleads innocent.
 Dredd (Sly) is the most fearsome, toughest, silliest looking of all the judges, his name is spoken in such a way to tell us so. This time however he finds himself on the wrong side of the law (""I am the law""), framed for a murder and forced to go the Richard Kimble route to prove his innocence, taking along with him a petty criminal (Rob Schneider) who has the misfortune to be handcuffed or shackled or something to Dredd.
 The bad guy is a rogue Nazi judge (Jurgen Prochnow) who has his sights set on an even more cluttered future world with cloned judges doing the jobs of totally capable currently living officers. So he in lists the help of Ricco (Armand Assante) who also happens to be Dredd's brother and whom he judged and sent to prison. Yada yada yada.
 I wish I could say that the movie has never looked more dreadful, but truth is that it looks pretty darn good in this new Blu-ray edition. We can see and appreciate the hard work that went into the corny, but stylish production design. The visual effects are quite good, even by today's standards, not as much silly looking CGI as I had expected, this future world looks sort of like the world of the Fifth Element, maybe at night. It's such a vivid creation it's a shame it's in the service of such a routine action picture.
 Stallone is severely miscast as Dredd, he looks and sounds silly, also I have never seen him hammier than this. The performance is so broad, you have to wonder is Sly thought this was a comedy. However, an interesting review by Roger Ebert from the time of the movie's release has him disagreeing with me and writing that Stallone is ""ideal for a role this, because he is smart enough and funny enough to pull it off."" I like Stallone too, I gleefully overpraised his recent the Expendables 2, but I'm not sure what Roger was thinking, Sly isn't funny and I won't touch upon the subject of his smarts.
 Also very bad is Schneider, in a role written for Joe Pesci, he seems badly out of place. He has terrible one liners, slows down the action, and is completely unnecessary. This movie is already too campy, we don't require additional comic relief.
 Yet, it is this film's strong supporting cast that stands out. Assante and Prochnow are excellent as the villains. Diane Lane is gorgeous and tough in equal measures as Dredd's partner and love interest. There are good bits from James Remar and Scott Wilson. Max Von Sydow delivers a surprisingly vivid and moving performance that doesn't belong here, but is very welcome none the less. Joan Chen, unfortunately appears just so that Lane has someone to fight with at the end.
 I always felt that this movie either needed to be a lot tougher or a lot more comical, the recent film tells me it's the former, not the later. Still, I have got to admit, it wasn't as bad as I remember it being. The flying motorcycle chase recalls the final to Star Wars, and the closing theme song by the Cure is a little beauty all it's own. Despite it's R-rating, this is much more tame than many PG-13 films today, and will be best appreciated by those not old enough for the new movie and too young to recall the first released.

The pilot movie which is included had someone else in Doug McClures role. But, that changed with the first episode. Shatner plays an undercover lawman who moves around the Barbary Coast unnoticed in many exotic and/or simple disguises. Half the fun, is watching him go from disguise to disguise. Shatner pulls each persona off perfectly, from a Chinese servant to a wanted outlaw/gunslinger. McClure is the owner of a gambling house that Shatner resides in. There is a hidden passage that leads to a room, where Shatner resides. Shatner's character has a hold over McClures character where he (according to the pilot) knows that McClures character is wanted elsewhere for killing a governer's son. As of the series, Shatner's character saved the life of McClure's character.

Shame on the director for allowing the ruination of this great masterpiece in the extended form!

GREAT FILM RUINED- BY BY BAD EDITING.
Here is what others are saying: ""The big disappointment for me was buying the Limited Edition version with the extended edition of the movie. 25 minutes of additional footage has been added back in for the extended version.  Like someone posted earlier, When viewing the ""extended"" version my player had to pause every time it went to a ""deleted scene."" It had to pause again when it went back to the theatrical version. I have other disks in my collection which have extended versions with deleted scenes cut into the film that were done seamlessly.

Not only was there a pause when switching between versions, but many times there was a shift in color cast and certain chapters (18 & 19 for me)of the movie became unwatchable and just froze up. For 30 Bucks I found this to be disgraceful and I will ask Best Buy for either another copy or just get the standard edition..

You have the option to watch either the original version or this extended version. The image quality, color and clarity vary a bit as it cuts between the theatrical version and the deleted scenes. Clearly, this wasn't recut and retimed for this ""extended"" version. The difference between the finished film and the added scenes are quite noticeable and jarring. A flawed masterpiece, Ray would have been a better film if the 25 minutes of additional footage had been integrated into this DVD in a better fashion than it is. No justice for the consumer, and none for the artists of the film and artist portrayed in the film.""

I know a lot of people had problems with the extended version of the DVD, but it warns you that it might not play well on certain DVD players.

Adventures: The Mystery Map"" exclusively through Wal-Mart. Imagine the familiar characters from ""Scooby-Doo"" if they were turned into Muppets. The 45-minute mini-movie will thrill children and even parents who don't dig too deep below the surface.

Scooby-Doo and the gang embark on a search for buried treasure when a map is accidently left in their pizza. The lost treasure belongs to a pirate named Gnarlybeard. The quest gets difficult when the Phantom Parrot steals the map from the sleuths and their clue-sniffing canine. They must track down the mysterious bird and recover the map if they ever want to find out what's inside Gnarlybeard's treasure chest.

""Scooby-Doo! Adventures: The Mystery Map"" is based in the world of ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo."" To jog memories, the Saturday morning cartoon series featured Scooby and his pals as children. Remember back when every cool cartoon franchise was intent on turning their characters into pint-sized ankle biters? ""The Flintstone Kids,"" ""Tiny Toons Adventures,"" ""The New Archies,"" and ""Muppet Babies"" are perfect examples of this obsession.

If you don't get too picky, ""Scooby-Doo! Adventures: The Mystery Map"" is entertaining. The sets and backgrounds all look good. It does seem like the filmmakers had a hard time figuring out exactly how to get the puppets properly framed in the picture at times. However, none of that really matters when your target market are children who aren't going to complain about those sorts of things.

Most of the familiar voice actors who we've come to identify as these characters lend their talents to ""Scooby-Doo! Adventures: The Mystery Map."" Frank Welker plays both Scooby-Doo and Fred as usual. Matthew Lillard breathes life into Shaggy and Grey DeLisle Griffin portrays Daphne. Mindy Cohn is replaced as the voice of Velma by Stephanie D'Abruzzo (""Sesame Street,"" ""The Book of Pooh"").

There's not much to be found in the way of bonus material for ""Scooby-Doo! Adventures: The Mystery Map."" The first is an episode of ""Scooby-Doo! Where Are You?"" entitled ""The Backstage Rage."" The second is the episode ""Robopup"" from ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo."" It would've been interesting to see some ""behind-the-scenes"" footage of the puppeteers working.

""Scooby-Doo! Adventures: The Mystery Map"" knows exactly who its target audience is and hits the mark. I can see where they could take the puppet concept of this movie and make it work as a new TV or movie series for the franchise.

For actress Natalie Portman, Black Swan has offered the best role and she has delivered the best performance of her career.  She lost 20 pounds to play the role.

Nina Sayers operates in the highly competitive and perfectionistic world of ballet.  She is perfectionistic and insecure.  'I just want to be perfect.' When the prima ballerina played by Winona Ryder is forced to retire, because she is considered too old though she is still young, numerous dancers vie for her position, to play the lead role in the Black Swan. In the story the white swan representing the light wants the prince, and the black swan representing the dark side swoops in and seduces the prince.

The dancer has to dance both roles. In the privacy of the bathroom and away from public eyes her insecurities get the better of her. So begins the descent into madness.  In order to play both roles she has to tap her own dark side, which she has repressed all her life.  The question becomes will she be able to play the role and recover, and triumph, or will she so overidentify with the role that she meets a similar fate as the white swan.  The director of the ballet grabs her.  He has seduced the prima ballerinas before, and says 'I want there to be no boundaries between us.' Almost as soon as the production starts, the black swan manifests in the form of Mila Kunis, who coincidentally has black wings tattooed on her back.

At home the controlling mother played brilliantly by Barbara Hershey has no sense of boundaries, and intrudes in her private domain of the bathroom, and the bedroom.

Almost as soon as the production starts, the black swan manifests in the form of Mila Kunis, who coincidentally has black wings tattooed on her back, and onto whom she projects her insecurities. Will she seduce the dark prince, the director.

What I liked particularly about this movie is the seamlessness of the directors vision.  Sometimes its dissociated as she is in the picture and we are following her.  When this happens we are in reality.  The it moves to the subjective and we are seeing what she sees, and we are having having some of the same difficulties she has determining what is real and what is projection, and we find it difficult sometimes to tell the difference.  Much has been made of the raunchy love scene with Mila Kunis, and it was good.

In fact, if you are like me you may need to watch it a second time to figure this out better.

Typically, the Academy award goes for two types of roles:

1. The psychopath eg no Country for Old men, and There Will be blood

2.  The person with a social or personal disability, having to deal with great adversity, overcoming great odds, mental illness addiction etc. eg Jeffrey Rush in Shine  Russell Crowe in a Beautiful Mind, Jeff Bridges as an alcoholic in Crazy Heart.

If this year follows the usual pattern, Natalie Portman will win as the mentally ill ballerina, Colin Firth as the Stammering king in The Kings Speech, and Chrisian bale as the crackhead boxing coach in The Fighter.  While I favor Aronofsky for Best Picture and Best Director, it's by no means as clear cut as the the acting categories, as the Fighter, True Grit and Kings Speech are very evenly matched for quality.

The Second Barrage was even better, with content so extreme it's difficult to watch.

I am happy to proclaim a new champion on the hill: Jormungand. While Black Lagoon's crew are tied together by fear and mutual exploitation, Jormungand's operation is slick, well-oiled and cemented on a solid foundation of respect and co-operation. Most of Koko's crew are ex-army elites (except for Jonah). Velmet is one of the most formidable and terrifying femme fatales of the past decade in anime. Her story arc spans several episodes and is almost resolved at the end of the series. Almost.

Character development is complete and never dull. The majority of expositions are crisp and to the point. Villains are a riot to watch and never overstay their welcome. The man-girl slaughterhouse Orchestra and the threesome of havoc are two cases in point. Speaking of which, so are the battle scenes. They're never slow or drawn-out. It's like the budget for Hellsing Ultimate was crammed into 4-minute bursts of sheer action win.

All are welcome additions to the cast. Arguably, the best new class lineup. And also the last to feature Sarah Lancaster as Rachel. Highlights this season include ""Fall Formal"", ""Trash TV"", ""Fire at the Max"" and ""The Kiss"" featuring (in a rare TNBC crossover) Megan Parlen & Amy Wright as Mary Beth Pepperton & Paige Peterson from other popular TNBC show, Hang Time.

The audio is fine and consistent with the previous sets while the video quality (seemingly improved, though still could be better) is apparently the best that Image Entertainment can muster.

The Blu-ray has a frame-by-frame restoration done by the UCLA film school. It's truly a gorgeous picture with excellent sound. Interesting interviews and extras can be found on the Blu-ray also.

In watching this movie it's apparent to me how much better Hollywood WAS at dealing with political issues.  At the time this picture was made Social Security was a hot debate in America.  The Democrats favored a government system that we have now.  Republicans favored a mandatory system where people would save their own money, in their own accounts. The Democratic proposal had the advantage that it could be implemented almost immediately. The Republican plan would take longer to work because people would have to save when they are young for their retirement.  However, the Republican plan would have resulted in retired people having a lot more money to live on.  (Historically, beginning at age 22 if you put your money in the stock market instead of Social Security you would have about 7 times more money at age 65 compared to Social Security.)

Anyway, this movie is the story of a couple that completely runs out of assets and income in their 70s. To my knowledge, it is the only love story Hollywood ever made of a couple in their 70s.  This movie carries several messages. One of them, is the importance of saving for your own retirement. However, the primary message is about the couple's children and how they could have done more to help their parents.  I believe the movie does an excellent job of explaining Ephesians 6:2 Honor your father and mother.

Most movies are made for entertainment, Make Way for Tomorrow is trying to teach us something, and it does. At the end of this movie you will be a slightly different person than you were at the beginning, a better person.

I highly recommend the Blu-ray.

Mrs. Tim Burton (I forget her real name.  Oh, it's Helena Bottoms Carterer, my wife just yelled to me) is a solid B.

Why Firth and Burton's wife (or girlfriend or whatever) got nominated for Oscars is beyond me.  They won't win, that much is sure.

Now, Geoffrey Rush, the honorable Lionel, has his acting chops down, and really stole this movie completely, sort of like McCauley Calkin did for Home Alone.  Lionel is passionate, irreverent, unorthodox, somewhat vain, but always has the king's ""back"", as homies these days say.  If he were a speech therapist now, he'd likely get his pants sued off for not having a license, but that is now and this was then.  Back in the thirties, anyone with the kahones to call the future king Bertie without soiling themselves at the thought of being beheaded gets a high five and cowabunga sign from me, your honorable reviewer.  And Geoffrey Rush, in what was likely his first movie ever--I mean, I see a ton of flicks and I don't recall him in anything else; my wife is yelling over that she thinks he was Cooter in the new Dukes of Hazzard (but I think it was Bob Denver, frankly, but I'll keep my piehole shut lest I be sleeping on the divan for a week).

Actually, Wikipedia says that Mr. Rush won a Tony and and Emmy and an Academy award!  So, I guess he's at least been in an opera, in a circus, and one other movie.  My son just walked by and recognized Geoffrey Rush from Pirates of the Caribbean (I won't correct the seven year old, but I'd bet my left thumb that was Gerard Depardieu in Pirates.  Oh, well).

So, all in all, if your PBS on Dish Network goes out when you're late paying your monthly bill, rent this Masterpiece Theater ditty and watch some mediocre acting except for Lionel, who is much improved from Cooter, and shows some real talent in this one.  I hear Scorcese is considering another Goodfellas update, a new installment, and I think Mr. Rush would be ideal as Maury the Wig salesman.

It works on a visceral level as a straightforward tale of survival amidst the harshest conditions imaginable, but underneath the surface there's all manner of allegorical goodness also at play. It's intense and powerful no matter how you choose to take it, though, and that's the sign of a real masterwork. That whole stack of cards teeters on Hanks's work in the central role, of course, and he flat-out crushes it. In a way, his whole career up to this point has been preparing him for this kind of an effort; I can see shreds of many of his earlier roles, alive in his gamut of expressions, as he slowly, grimly comes to terms with the fact that there's no form of rescue on the horizon. He's familiar but lost, a modern-day everyman denied his tool belt, stripped bare to the very core of his being. It's an all-world performance, easily among the best of his career, though it didn't quite draw the accolades that his turns in Philadelphia or Forrest Gump enjoyed. Behind the lens, Robert Zemeckis also hands in some of his best work. Experimenting with before-their-time camera angles and quick, effective snapshots of daily life on the island, he's able to evolve his craft without losing touch with his typically warm, lush brand of storytelling. And, needless to say, Cast Away's famous crash scene remains one of film's most historically intense, white-knuckle rides. I didn't realize I'd been holding my breath until it was all over. A fantastic picture that only stumbles in the payoff, lingering in the moment for longer than it really should, then momentarily giving in to its indulgent, romantic side.",Hanks is Revelatory in His Beach-Stranded One Man Show,1411948800,,

To watch this fan collection, you must keep in mind you won't get all your favorites in a FAN collection. And others have said this fact previously in their reviews and I echo this fact. You also must remember the studio (Paramount) is trying to milk its cash cow (STAR TREK) to death, so know they will be selective..sometime too selective for my tastes

Now in saying that previous statement and fact in the last paragraph,  I enjoyed what was here in this DVD Klingon  collection. It covered all the Treks with one to two episodes each of live action trek series including Enterprise. The episodes gives TREK fans a taste of Klingon. In also show the diverse ideals of the Klingon nation from Foe to Ally. Also this collection is a great character overview of the warror race.

However for TREK fans NOTE, especially for Tribble fans, It has the classic trek's Trouble with Tribble and the DS9 Salute Trials and Tribble-uations. But it does miss the animated More Tribbles, More Troubles (guess I have to wait until december for all the animated Trek box set!).

For what is here, its great. The DVD masters copies are clean and clear of defects. Notes, there is text comments on a few episodes but no actor commentary. One could hope for this collection that it would include an audio except from the Simon & Schuster audio's Conversational Klingon narrated by the greatest Klingon of all- Michael (Worf) Dorn , however no luck.

There are many missed episodes that they also could have included like Classic Trek's Day of the Dove, well we can hope there is a volume two of Klingon

So Paramount DVD, what's your next fan collection?  Vulcans  (including Spock)? Scotty? Data? Doctors? Orion Slave girls? The Fan DVD  collections have  already covered the Borg, Q and Time Travel...we can only hope whats next

Until then Live Long and Prosper

Schoth,"When Peter is kidnapped by rebels in Tecala, his wife, Alice, is left in fear of who to trust to save her husband.  A Kidnap & Rescue negotiator arrives to help, only to discover Peter was a subcontractor and therefore, the company he was contracting for is not responsible for his return (summary: the company's insurance did not cover his safety, therefore will not pay for the expert Kidnap & Rescue negotiator to attempt to save Peter; leaving Alice to hire a negotiator with little to no experience, and try and raise money for the ransom).
However, Thorne (K&R negotiator) leaves Tecala, only to return again, just in time before Alice trusted a huge amount of money to the inexperienced negotiator and lost everything - even her husband.
Though it seems unlikely that a romance would blossom out of such a tragedy, the movie carefully shows where feelings begin to take root.  Thorne returned to save Peter out of his strong attraction to Alice.  Alice feels nothing except fear for her husband, but as time goes on and the ups and downs of each phase in the rescue, Alice and Thorne open up a little at a time to each other about all aspects of their lives - until a natural care for each other develops.  With Thorne being basically Alice's ""knight in shining armour,"" and the close friendship they develop together for the next several months... it's only natural that strong emotions and thoughts of love seap into the minds of both Alice and Thorne.  However, though the attraction is great, Alice realizes her true love is Peter and doesn't waver from that fact.  Thorne, realizes too, that his goal of returning Peter will in fact mean he will never have Alice - however, he cannot sacrifice another good person, so he can have his wife.  This will leave you feeling good about being an American for one thing!!

Personally, I find little evidence of director Edgar G. Ulmer's celebrated genius on display here (sorry Ulmerophiles). The movie never really rises above it's poverty-stricken origins, yet rarely generates genuinely enjoyable Bad Film ambience either. Gloria Talbott (The Cyclops, I Married a Monster from Outer Space) is radiant as Janet Smith [Jekyll], genre icon John Agar is his usual tabula rasa self, and Arthur Shields is annoyingly Barry Fitzgerald-ish as 'kindly' Dr. Lomas. The script by no-budget producer Jack Pollexfen (Neanderthal Man, Indestructible Man, Monstrosity) is strictly pedestrian, a curious hodgepodge of the Jekyll/Hyde story and werewolf/vampire legends, incorporating such hoary devices as the secret passage behind the bookcase and the monster leering at the half-dressed cheesecake model. The embarrassingly corny ""are you sure?"" opener and closer is sure to cling to your brain like an exceptionally irritating TV commercial. The movie also suffers at times from lack of budget (exteriors of the 'mansion' are an all-too-obvious model), although it does boast some terrific-looking cobwebs and atmospheric fog scenes. Keep an eye out for the underutilized though potentially quite effective red/green filter technique employed, if less than stunningly, for the monster's climactic transformations (see Mamoulian's 1932 Jekyll & Hyde, She Devil [1957], or Bava's Black Sunday for its much more effective application). Trivia note: Talbott apparently was co-featured with herself on a double-bill of this movie and The Cyclops back in 1957.
Allday continues their tradition of giving first-class DVD treatment to neglected films with this release. The 1.85:1 letterboxed DVD is mastered from the original 35mm fine grain positive and looks excellent overall in terms of brightness, contrast, sharpness, grayscale, and shadow/highlight detail. There is some sporadic very light speckling and spotting, a few stretches with very minor vertical scratches, and some of the exteriors and fog scenes look a bit soft and grainy, but the source print is still far above average for a film of its type and age. Extras include an overall excellent-quality, lightly speckled trailer; isolated music and effects track; still and poster gallery; and on-camera monologues by John Agar (9 mins) and Arianne Ulmer Cipes (16 mins). Ms. Cipes discusses the preservation/legal issues involved with the movie and DVD release, recalls producer Jack Pollexfen, and compares today's indie filmmakers with Ulmer in his pioneering early years. Agar reminisces about his early John Ford films and Universal-era SF flicks, relating precious little about DoDJ; genre fans who read 'zines like Scarlet Street, Psychotronic Video, or Filmfax regularly will learn virtually nothing new in his segment.

He gets a lot of flack as a director, but I think he is top-notch at what does.  No, not because he makes great films, but because he makes great ACTION films.  They may be dumb, but they look great and always have better, rock `em, sock `em, blow-you-through-the-back-wall-of-the-theater action and stunt sequences than the competition.  Considering what he did with the buddy (""Bad Boys"", ""The Rock"") and disaster genres (""Armageddon"" - again, dopey, but it looked great), I was really looking forward to seeing what he could do with $200 mil to have giant robots beat the livin' s**t out of each other.

But, alas, ""Transformers"" just kind of sat there on the screen for me.  It was not for a lack of stuff blowing up or any of Bay's usual trademarks, but this film felt more generic than some of his other testosterone fests.  Maybe it's because of all the CGI use in the action scenes instead of being able to film actual car chases and shoot-outs with real cars and stunt people the way he normally does.

I dunno, but ""Transformers"" had an air of ""seen this before"" to it.  The movie was okay and for the most part entertaining, but I was not blown away by any of the action sequences the way I thought I would be in this, surely Bay's biggest film to date. They look the same way a lot of these big, SCI-FI, CG action sequences look.

Also they were often just a big blur.  The robots weren't distinguishable enough from one another during the battle sequences, which themselves were chopped and cut in a far too spastic fashion. Between these two flaws, you often you could not tell what the hell was going on; which character was victorious or who was hurt, etc.

And my God, so much of the dialog and teen-centric baboonery was just plain corny.  Now, I know Bay is reaching for a wider and perhaps younger audience, or maybe trying to recapture the tone of the cartoon source material, so I guess that may explain the corny dialogue and cheesy plot elements (not that that makes it any less groan-inducing), but the action is what this film should be about, and for all its big set pieces, noise and feverish cuts, it never got me all rah-rah the way it was obviously trying to.  I never felt like I was really rooting for anyone or was in any kind of suspense about the outcome.  Stuff blows up really good, but that's about it.  Its fun for a while, but it gets old-hat pretty quickly when they just keep throwin' another F/X shot up on the screen that looks just like the last one to keep the audience Oooo-ing and Ahhh-ing.  And the movie drags on too long.

I will say this though, the Transformers, as designed, look great (though I sympathize with the purist fans who are upset that the makers did not stay true to most of the Transformers actual disguises, weapons and backstory; to that end I think they missed a big opportunity by basically ignoring the Decepticons until the last 20 minutes of the movie and providing little insight into their personalities and internal conflicts, something the cartoon did so well) and there are some good performances from the cast, despite some of the stupid stuff the script has them do and say, and the fact that many of the supporting players are completely pointless in a movie that already feels overstuffed (what exactly was the point of the Aussy hacker, or Anthony Anderson, well besides comic relief that is).

In a summer of big sequels and remakes and $300 million-plus budgeted blockbusters, it ironic that the fourth ""Die Hard"" - a movie produced for far less dough, was not nearly as hyped as the others, and seemed to have 'bad idea' written all over it - is the only one that really delivers for fans of the series.  ""Transformers"" is not a terrible movie by any means, it just is nothing special and it doesn't do much to reward its faithful followers.  I guess, next to ""Die Hard,"" of all the sequels and remakes this summer, it would rank second, but that's really only by default considering, say,  ""Pirates 3"" made me want to pound my f'ing head into the seat in front of me.  So its competition is pretty non-existent.  And, admittedly, 12 year-old boys (for whom movies like this are mostly intended) will probably think this is the greatest movie they have ever seen... until the next big F/X action blockbuster hits theatres.

Hopefully ""Die Hard's"" dip at the box office will be slim in weeks to come.  Of course it won't out-gross gargantuan dueling robots, but it certainly deserves to.",2 1/2 Stars.  Movie Is Far Less Than What Met My Eye In the Trailers,1183852800,,

Something that makes me think for long time even after the moive is finished.
In this movie Elizabeth Tayler suffers from mental problem after witnessing his cousin's death.  Montgomery Clift, a brain doctor decides to help her. When him and Elizabeth and the aunt of her's who is played by Katharin Hapburn all got together, Montgomery pull out everything in Elizabeth's mind to cure her. That is a very long scene. From that moment, the doctor figures out that the real problem is not her but her aunt.
That is the main point from this film.
Katharin played her evil roll so well that she even made me shake and my hair all stand up, if there's a word like that.
There are too many dialogues but the last scene was a memorable and I cannot complain about the long dialogues at all since William's plays are all like that.
Elizabeth and Hapburn are so good that Montgomery's acting was almost invsible.
Two main actresses were alomst like growling the whole time. I never seen one like that before.
I don't see classic movies that much. But this is a pleasant surprise.
The movie was shot in Black and white and was 1.85:1. Full screen for the widescreen TV.
The location was very limited and I liked it that way.

His naturalistic, unguarded, venomous portrayal of unscrupulous oilman Daniel Plainview will leave you shaking, and i feel its one of the best portrayals of human greed ive ever seen on film. The first 15 to 20 minutes, theres absolutely no dialogue, as we see Plainview as a young driller in a group searching for oil. After that, we see him and a young boy he adopts as his own son named H.W., come to a small town called Little Boston, where they pose as quail hunters, but in actuality, are there to find oil at the property of Eli Sunday, brilliantly played by Paul Dano. Sunday is a young preacher, thought to be a spiritual healer. Without giving too much away, over time, Plainview and Sunday don't see eye to eye, both men have their own reasons for doing the things they do, and with Plainview, we see firsthand how greedy and spiteful and deranged he becomes as the years pass and his wealth grows. To say hes not a likeable man is an UNDERSTATEMENT, and you wonder if deep down he wants us to hate him as much as he says he hates all other people around him. He proves to be out for self and is willing to openly sacrifice all those near him for what he feels is rightfully his to claim.

After seeing her in Ghost World and then years later in Lost in Translation, I have fallen in love with her classic beauty and superb acting. So let me put it out there - I saw this movie to see Scarlett.
As an artist, I found the film to be intriguing. Almost every scene, like a Vermeer, had perfect light, wonderful color, and fantastic composition. The cinematography is breathtaking. But also, as the characters prance around in an utterly perfect atmosphere, it is hard to miss the superb acting of the cast as a whole, especially by the females. Griet (Johannson), her mistress, and her misstress' mother are all played with quiet conviction and simulatenous compassion. While each character holds in place, none, even the young daughter, is without multiple dimensions and vast emotion.
That said, the film had a feel for a made-for-TV movie. The plot was subtle yes. But much happened - maybe too much.  Meanwhile, there were parts of the film that drove me insane (why was the sky high noon blue when the light in the room was that of early evening?), but it did manage to keep me calmly entertained.

Having bought their products for several years I have seen the quality transfers they provide for films which often appeal to dedicated film collectors - those who value early cinema. The picture quality of these, some of the first films made by Walt Disney, was quite good.  Additionally VCI identified the source for their prints which helped explain how it was possible for them to make this set.. The extras especially the synopsis listing of each title, was a nice touch.

I laughed so hard that I nearly hyperventilated, and I felt something like stabbing pain in my ribcage, so that the rest of the evening I had to grasp my chest with my arms to keep from hurting myself. I laughed and laughed and laughed, and then the opening credits ended and the film began.
As funny as the opening credits are, the film matches them. The skits are just off the chart absurd, and all the better for it. The film has penetrated popular imagination to such an extent that people aren't even aware sometimes of the origins of some of the things they hear. For instance, I played an online MMRPG (massively multiplayer role playing game), and in that game there were numerous players who played mages with some permutations of Tim, another named Brave Sir Robin, and one quest in the game was to get a gang of people to kill a tiny white rabbit that was capable of killing dozens of those attacking it. One group of players formed a monarchy called The Knights Who Say Ni. Outside that game, merely mentioning the words ""African swallow"" can evoke laughter in some quarters.
Even today, this movie remains one of the most original, intelligent comedies ever made. The entire conceit of making a comedy about King Arthur and the search for the Holy Grail is a bizarre one, but the Python boys pull it off with style. The skits (for there really is not a plot so much as a general framework for hanging great skits on) are extraordinarily intelligent, unusual, and, best of all, hysterically funny. To this day, except for other Monty Python films, there has been no humor along the lines in this film in either England or the United States, and that's a pity. This isn't easy humor to reproduce. It takes a certain amount education, a certain level of literacy, a certain level of intelligence, and very definitely a level of comic genius. What is brilliant is that the humor can move from highly cerebral political satire (the peasants who refuse to acknowledge Arthur as their king merely because he had been chosen by ""a watery tart"" who gave him Excalibur) to the delightfully absurd (the syllogisms by which a knight proves that a witch and a duck weigh the same, and then placing a duck on one side of a scale and the witch on the other, incredibly proving that she was indeed a witch) to the out and out farcical (the Black Knight).
The DVD set is spectacular, with a host of the kinds of features DVD lovers crave. I had previously owned the movie on VHS, but the DVD has a vastly clearer print with more vivid colors.",A magnificent blend of cerebral and slapstick humor,1054598400,,

I will say that if (an exceedingly large 'IF') if Director Andrew Bellware's intent is to become the new Schlock King, attempting to secure Ed Wood's crown for himself, then he needs to be more sublime in his productions; a greater effort toward self-awareness by proudly taking ownership of lousy filmmaking.

This BY NO MEANS makes it unbiblical. Rather, I believe that his research has helped to hone and correct many interpretations of end times theology which are in error.

I believe that I am doing him justice by saying that his approach to biblical eschatology centers on the view that ALL end-times prophecy is centered on - and ONLY on - the Middle East. So, for example, there will be no rise of an Italian army. Nor will Russia lead an invasion into Israel. For those of you who have been steeped in this doctrine, I encourage you to look at what Joel has written in his books and has produced in this fantastic video.

In this video, Mr. Richardson has visually represented the core aspects of his book, ""The Mideast Beast"" in an extraordinary way. If, like me, you are impressed with his previous work, you will very much enjoy this video. If you are not familiar with his views on biblical end-times, you will find this video to be an extremely well done production explaining his view of how end times events will unfold in the Middle East.

Read his books. Watch this video. You will have your eyes opened to biblical truths that you may never have been exposed to in the past.",An Excellent Production of Current and Future Events to Unfold in the Middle East,1421452800,6,
2.0,False,"07 27, 2015",A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B00WDQNYUM,{'Format:': ' DVD'},G. Teslovich,"Positives:
1. Dialogue especially lines meant to be humorous or sarcastic (Freeman's lines) were the highlight of the film.
2. The buying and selling of an apartment in New York was insightful. At least those parts that might be accurate.

Negatives:
1. The young girl (accompanies mom who is looking at the apt. Freeman is selling) and appears every so often in the film while also offering sage advice to Freeman, was expecting tea as a reward yet we never see her again. That's called a loose end. I would have had her and her mom moving into another vacant apartment in that building resulting in an intelligent relationship with Freeman & Keaton (Freeman's wife).
2. Too many of the buyers/sellers were characterized as a bit too greedy, self centered or off centered for me.
3. Most importantly the script had Freeman and Keaton dissing their agent at the end (treating like trash as they turned their backs while walking away) after their last second changing of minds on selling. Particularly disconcerting given the tremendous amount of work that agent put into the sales preparation with her only compensation to be the sales commission.
4. Wasn't sure how anything was added by having a supposed terrorist; their dog in the hospital; their flashbacks; Freeman's paintings, to, what might have been, a more intelligent story.",Poor Value Judgments,1437955200,,

After reading the synopsis it seemed like a pretty interesting film so I decided to give it a shot. After watching the film, I felt like it was a time well spent. This is my review of A Letter to Momo.

Artwork: The animation style of this film is a little bit different from other anime types of animation. Most anime characters resemble westerners where they have bigger eyes and other physical characteristics that depict westerners. I am happy to say that this film is a deviation from that and you can tell that the animators truly wanted to depict Japanese people in the films. It was a very nice authentic experience when it came to looking at character sprites.

The settings of the film art magnificently drawn and you can tell that the animators are no nonsense. Every single detail is drawn with the utmost precision and it was quite a joy to look at. If you want to see some nice artwork on landscapes, this might be a bonus.

Story: I will try to be as spoiler free as possible. The story is good, not amazingly great. It was entertaining but I did find myself to get slightly bored from time to time. You can definitely tell that it isn't targeted for adults but more for middle school to late elementary children. However, it was still a joy to watch through good storytelling.

I expected the movie to be somewhat depressing since the Japanese have a fondness for melodrama but I found it not to be the case. MOst of the film was pretty carefree and the concept of death was not targeted extensively on until near the end of the film. Instead, a great hunk of the film was targeted on Momo finding the Yokai and then dealing with their eccentric behaviors. I found one particular yokai to be extremely annoying though and he made my overall experience of the movie worse. I felt like his character was too annoying while the remaining two though mischievous, were a likely addition to the cast of characters. But when you do get to the very end be ready to be emotionally engaged. I am not a crier in most films but I did find myself tearing up in a certain scene.

Conclusion: A Letter to Momo was a lighthearted film that is both carefree and entertaining. It can even be classified as a coming off age story. It is not the best anime film out there, but it is still an enjoyable experience.",An Interesting Plot,1420848000,6,
